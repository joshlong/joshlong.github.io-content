[{"appearance": "OOP German Conference- Spring with live coding # Cloud Native Java Abstract: Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It\u2019s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage. Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget \u201cdevops,\u201d cloud-based services and platforms automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards. But velocity, for velocity\u2019s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this talk, we\u2019ll look at how high performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.", "start_date": "2/9/2021", "end_date": "2/9/2021", "time": "9:45am - 12:15pm PT", "marketing_blurb": "Join me for the epic OOP Java conference where I'll be talking about Cloud Native Java"}, {"appearance": "JavaDayLviv 2021 (Josh should use his email josh@joshlong.com to login and receive the\nconfirmation link.)", "start_date": "2/18/2021", "end_date": "2/18/2021", "time": "11:30pm PST", "marketing_blurb": "I'll be speaking at JavaDayLviv and I hope to see you there!"}]
