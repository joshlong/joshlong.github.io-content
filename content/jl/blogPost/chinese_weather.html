<p>In related news, I woke up to rain today.  

it's freaking <EM>cold</EM> in China. Northern parts of China - like <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/harbin">Harbin</a> - already cold enough that it's famous for its ice festivals in which amazing and beautiful ice structures are  constructed  in a true winter-wonderland fashion - have seen daytime HIGHS of -22C. Nanjing, which is an hour's train ride from Shanghai, where I am, hit -6 C for daytime lows. And, when the SpringSource team and I were in Beijing for <a href="http://springonechina.cloudfoundry.com">SpringOne Beijing 2012</a> we routinely hit temperatures of -8 or -9C. Brrr! I hope you're warmer, wherever  you are.

<p> I'm originally from Los Angeles, and sometimes gets, and while I'm now in rainy San Francisco, I'm not used to this kind of cold.  I much prefer the cold to the hot mugginess of a humid summer, however, so I suppose this will just have to do.

<p> As you can imagine, slingshotting from Beijing, China (at -8C) to Hyderabad and Bangalore in India, where it's a warm 30 C or so, has not been easy on the immune system. I've got a cold. Oh well..   </p>
