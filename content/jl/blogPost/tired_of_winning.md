I'm so tired of all this _winning_. 

* [100,000 people dead from COVID19](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/25/lives-lost/?arc404=true). ([Trump was golfing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethcohen/2020/05/23/trump-golfs-as-us-mourns-100000-dead--the-presidents-ugly-memorial-day-message/#3518ce8b7062)). There's [_always_ a tweet](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-tweets-about-obama-coronavirus-ebola-reveal-hypocrisy-his-crisis-ncna1153666): in 2014, he politicized the Ebola pandemic and insisted that President Obama should resign for golfing. [_Two_ Americans died in America during that crisis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_cases_in_the_United_States)
* We saw the [GDP shrink 5% in Q1](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/05/28/business/bc-us-economy-gdp.html). We don't know the numbers for Q2. I'm not sure I want to... There are 21 million ongoing 
* There have now been a [total of 41 million unemployed](https://www.wpri.com/news/us-and-world/us-unemployment-numbers-may-28/), and a little less than 21 million continuing unemployed.
* [Trump's harassing states for supporting mail-in ballots](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-threatens-funding-for-michigan-nevada-over-absentee-mail-in-voting-plans/2020/05/20/2f86d078-9aa2-11ea-ac72-3841fcc9b35f_story.html). Senator Kamala Harris (D.) had to remind Trump that it's a crime to threaten to withold funding to [the state to interfere with elections](https://twitter.com/kamalaharris/status/1263626128931110913?s=12). Republican Senator Mitt Romney responded that 90% of  ([He](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/08/politics/donald-trump-vote-by-mail-absentee/index.html) and [his press secretary](https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2020/05/27/trump-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-has-voted-by-mail-11-times-in-10-years/), among others, all use mail-in ballots). Even Texans [want (and now can have) mail-in voting](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/05/19/federal-judge-says-texas-voters-can-vote-mail-during-coronavirus/)
* We had the first [terrorist attack on US soil since 9/11](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/opinion/mike-pompeo.html).  
* Trump is threatening [social media companies](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1265255835124539392?s=12) (but this will of course also really screw conservative sites like Breitbart.com). He just signed an executive order to start the ball rolling for the government [to harass social media platforms](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/05/28/trump-social-media-order-expected-go-after-twitter-facebook/5265312002/).
* Trump's trying to rollback even more environmental regulations. ([And states are fighting back](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/climate/lawsuit-fuel-economy-climate.html?referringSource=articleShare))
* Trump is demanding that [houses of worship be allowed to open up again](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/us/coronavirus-news-live-updates.html)
* Trump is [threatening states who insist](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-05-19/trump-justice-dept-accuses-california-of-violating-religious-rights-with-coronavirus-restrictions) that their citizens shelter-at-home and avoid the plague 
* The militarized [police](https://www.denverpost.com/2020/05/28/denver-protest-george-floyd-minneapolis-police-photos/) complex are caught, yet again, with their knees on the necks of the downtrodden. Trump has expressed evil thoughts about [Colin Kaepernick](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/trump-urges-nfl-owners-to-fire-players-who-protest/540897/) and [Black Lives Matter](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-black-lives-matter-2015-9?op=1). This is his unique flavor of bigotry.
* Trump insulted Columbia university for being the messenger that if the US had shutdown a little earlier, [many lives would've been saved](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/499385-trump-rips-columbia-as-disgraceful-institution-after-study-showed).

All of this was in the last ten days or so! And I know I've missed [a zillion other things](http://TheTrumpDump.info), too. 


So, let's please ask this November as we amble up to the voting box: are we better off than we were in 2016?
