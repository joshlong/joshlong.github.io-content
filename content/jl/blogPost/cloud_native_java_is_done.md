I'm so happy to say that, at long last,   _Cloud Native Java_ is done! [Get it while it's hot!](https://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Native-Java-Designing-Resilient/dp/1449374646/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1503905875&sr=8-1&keywords=cloud+native+java#customerReviews) We talk a bit more about it [on the official blog](http://cloudnativejava.io/post/cloud_native_java_is_done/).
