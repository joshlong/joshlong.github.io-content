I'm in a terminal at San Francisco Airport ("SFO," for those of us in the live-on-plains biz) waiting for my flight to Chicago. This year's going to be ridiculous. Honestly, I can't wait. 
</P>
<P>   I've <a href= "http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/speaker/josh_long">got <EM>three</EM> talks</A> - each 1.5 hours! So, eh, if you can't get enough of my ugly mug, then please join me for some of these  talks! </P>
	
	<P> One talk is with Roy Clarkson, we're co-presenting on <b>Native Android Development</b>.  This talk I look forward to quite a bit - Android's a powerful platform and certainly the most ubiquitious, so learning how to build a better Android application from client to server is <EM>very</EM> useful!  (I can't wait to make it even more ubiquitous when I buy my <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus">Galaxy Nexus!</a>). 
 </P> 
<P> <img src = "/media/17834" style = "float:right; margin-left :10px;"/>  My second talk is a deep dive at Spring Batch. Sure, anybody can sling together a Spring Batch application, but do you really know what's going on there? Do you know what you <em>could</em> do with Spring Batch? Spring Batch's so amazingly robust and feature rich that a lot of people just plunk down what they need to get their occasional batch processing solution finished, but don't stop to reflect on the power-user features as well as the details. This is a credit to Spring Batch - after all, the 80% case is <EM>super</EM> simple. But, you can take it and further, and this talk should be a great start for the curious. Additionally, because I'll be diving deep into some basic concepts, this talk will also be a good introduction to Spring Batch for the uninitiated.

	My last talk is that's a bit more medium-to-advanced level. In this talk, I'll introduce some of the Spring framework's various SPIs. Spring's a <em>very</EM> simple technology and it features a rich component model and framework libraries that you can pull down and use, a la carte. However, a lot of Spring's power is in the stuff right below the surface - the extension points. Come learn about some of my favorite extension points in this talk. Remember, these extension points are the same ones that we leverage in building other Spring frameworks like Spring Integration, Spring Batch, etc., so this isn't just idle speculation! The most demanding user of the Spring framework is often the  engineer trying to build a sister project!
