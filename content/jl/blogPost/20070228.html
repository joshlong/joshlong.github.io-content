<p>Gmail is down, and Iâve not been able to access it with any
sort of consistency for hours. What am I missing? Whatâs wrong? This has happened to me before, but never for this duration  </p>  <p> That aside, I've deployed updates to the Tapestry 4.1 Maven archetype,
and partly updated the documentation. An order of magnitude better, to
be sure, but there remains much more to be done...</p>
