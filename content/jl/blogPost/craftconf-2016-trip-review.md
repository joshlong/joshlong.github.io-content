This was my first Craft Conf. I have been invited every year since the debut and have always had to decline in order to make the Great Indian Developer Summit (a great show to be sure!), to which I was previous committed. This year, I *finally* remembered to give it a shot and I am _so_ glad I did! I met many of my heroes and heroines and see *many* old friends all in one dense, information packed show. The content was superb, the endless Nespresso and beer made the occasional intermissions go over well, and (incredibly!) the wi-fi was top-notch, as well. It was a genuinely good show.

There were two parts that weren't as great as they should be:

First, the electricity for the room I was in failed. I was one of the  first session talks after the keynote on the first day, so the whole thing hadn't yet been proven. This whole show was in an amazing [_train museum_, Magyar Vasúttörténeti Park](http://www.vasuttortenetipark.hu/), and so assembled with astonishingly good results just days before the big event! Unfortunately, this meant that while the engineers spent the first 25 minutes of my 40 minute slot trying to get the stage lighting and display working, I was left on stage just chatting with the audience. I tried to make up for it, later, in a smaller supposedly hands-on workshop which seemed to go over alright. The first session was 40 minutes. The later session was to be a hands-on session of 90 minutes. I was told I could repeat the earlier talk then, which I did. I hope it resonated with people. I would've liked to have been able to take the audience that was in my room with me on a journey, as planned, though I'm pleased people showed up later. Oh well..

Also, I was really keen on finally meeting [Kyle Kingsbury](http://twitter.com/aphyr), author of [the _Call Me Maybe_ series of blogs](https://aphyr.com/tags/Jepsen) that disect the availability, partitionability and consistency qualities of distributed systems in _excruciating, hilarious_ detail. Unfortunately, he fell ill with an ear infection before boarding his flight for Budapest. I don't know if you've ever had an ear infection but the _last_ thing you want to do is change atmospheric pressure! It's excruciating enough as it is! Obviously, I wish him a speedy recovery and look forward to seeing his streamed presentation this Saturday in the AM PST time. (Follow [him on Twitter for more](http://twitter.com/aphyr)!)

I took away a lot of great ideas from this show. A lot of great themes also resonated:

* agility is a way of working that is independant of any prescribed processes. Ignore the dogma.
* an agile organization learns, deploys and fails faster. This is a win.
* automation around builds, testing, production, and more were - as far as any of the speakers were concerned - long since arrived.
* Microservices, microservices, and microservices



Also, [I played Craft Conf selfie-Pokémon](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40starbuxman%20%23craftconf&src=typd) (gotta catch 'em all!) and took as many photos with friends as possible! :-)

I loved the speaker's gift, as well!

This show was a _lot_ of fun and I certainly hope to be invited back next year! In the meantime, though, I am _very_ excited to be returning to San Francisco (where I live!) in a few short hours, for the first time since the last week of January!
