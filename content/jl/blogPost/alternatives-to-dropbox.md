I need some recommendations for worthy alternatives to Dropbox. I've found a few but would love some input and recommendations as this will, no doubt, be *very* painful.

Here's the background on my motivations for leaving. I have an old credit card on file with Dropbox. It's about to expire and a few months ago Dropbox started sending me emails telling me to update it so as to ensure uninterrupted service. Fine. So, I logged into the website on iOS and tried to change my Credit Card and it gave me a cryptic message saying there was an error. It sometimes showed me an error saying it couldn't change the country code. I thought it might just be shite JavaScript and so tried it on Chrome on the Desktop. Same nonsense. I sent them an email asking for help and they responded, days later, that my country was Germany and that there's no way to change the country code without downgrading my account. I've never lived in Germany, nor had a credit card or a billing address, in Germany. It happened, however, that I was in Germany at the time I was trying to update my credit card. (I am not sure if this bit's related). So, after I made them promise me nothing would be lost if i briefly downgraded, I went ahead and did it. Logged in to the site, and... the _Change Payment_ option didn't exist! There's no way to specify a new credit card! Or any credit card! All this after a week of emails back and forth and an hour or two trying to fiddle with the credit card dialog. They can seamlessly sync my files to all manner of devices, anywhere in the world, but updating the country in the credit card dialog? IMPOSSIBLE! If they don't want $200/yearly, that's fine, I'll just go somewhere else.

So, what can you recommend? [Please let me know on Twitter](http://twitter.com/starbuxman)
