My friend [Charlie Nutter](https://twitter.com/headius/status/811092321169195008) shared this great Mark Twain quote on Twitter, and I want to capture it here.

"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime." â€•Mark Twain, _The Innocents Abroad/Roughing It_

As we wobble across the finish line of this horrendous year, I hope you'll keep that quote in your heart.
