Hi, Spring fans! I've decided to update my [**_Reactive Spring_**](https://reactivespring.io) book. I released the first edition in 2020. I want to get a minor update out of the way before Spring Framework 5 and Spring Boot 3 arrive. Then, once that generation lands and the ecosystem stabilizes around it, I hope to release another update.  

I'll make the finished update available on Amazon for Kindle and print editions once it's done. If you want to get your hands on the unfinished draft, it's available on  [Leanpub.com/reactive-spring](https://leanpub.com/reactive-spring). 

I love Leanpub for a number of reasons: 

* I make more money per unit sale than on Amazon (yay?) 
* I can get early editions out to the community whose feedback and validation I depend on to improve the book
* **most importantly**: buyers of the book are entitled to free updates for any single given edition. Because I consider this update to be relatively minor - a few new chapters and updated code and dependencies - I'm making it available to everybody who bought the first edition of the book as a huge _thank you_ for all your kind support of the project. 

I'll  publish it as a new edition on Amazon when it's done, hopefully soon.  

Thanks to all those who've sent me feedback on typos over the years and thanks to the countless many who've sent me kind words about the book on various media. 

The new book updates the contents to reflect the latest-and-greatest dependencies for the Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 3.x generation. I've already added a whole new chapter on Java, and I've almost completely rewritten and greatly expanded the scope of the chapter on I/O. 

I am still noodling over what else to introduce. It makes sense, I think, to include coverage of Kotlin, Spring Native, and Spring GraphQL. Stay tuned!
