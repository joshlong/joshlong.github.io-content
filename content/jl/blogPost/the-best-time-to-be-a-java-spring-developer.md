I say this a lot on Twitter/X/Bluesky/in my talks/wherever: "there's never been a better time to be a Java and Spring developer!" and people inquire: "why?" And sometimes, why not other languages like Python, Rust, Go, TypeScript, etc.

Here are some reasons:

* Java's syntax is getting simpler, while Python's is getting more complicated. Java has a strong typesystem and is loosening its syntax, where Python has a weak type system and is adding more syntax. I prefer Java and Kotlin's direction.
* If you're using Kotlin, you can still use Kotlin on the backend :-)
* Alibaba, eBay, Netflix, Paypal, Amazon, and most of the largest websites on the planet use the JVM (and Spring)
* the JVM is widely used - the most used? - in the enterprise for backend services (e.g., with Spring) and Android.
* Java virtual threads mean we enjoy the same or better scalability as many other languages, but with much less code (no async/await required)
* Java can be compiled into small form-factor native binaries that don't require a JRE distribution thanks to GraalVM native images
* the JVM is [fast](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc#submitting)
* Java's synax is rich, and if you can write Kotlin, C#, TypeScript, python, etc., you'll find familiar idioms in Java
* it's one of the most mature ecosystems and offers solutions for just about anything including CLIs, desktop UIs, games, backend applications and services, AI, microservices, big data, mobile, Kubernetes controllers, and more.
* Not technical: Java developers are well remunerated, typically.
