<p>In my last post I talked about habits geared towards acquisition of
skills. It does sometimes happen the other way â where you need to
unlearn something, or re-frame an existing skill in a different way in
order to advance with it. This is a natural part o moving forward in
life, of adapting. I like to think that I do an acceptable job of
keeping current, of adapting.
</p><p>The proof is in the pudding: how many skills do I have the have
been obsolesced*? I hadn't counted, honestly. I'm still not going to
count (not that you will see, anyway!) but you might try taking a look
at the <a href="http://www.obsoleteskills.com/skills/skills">Obsolete
Skills Wiki</a> to see if anything you've learned has become
irrelevant, and whether you've successfully crossed that chasm.
</p><p>
Don't freak out if you see something you swore was still relevant â
some of the entries are on the site, but are disputed! </p><p>
Some are pretty dead on, or scary. <a
href="http://www.obsoleteskills.com/skills/countingbackchange">"Counting
back change"</a> is - saddeningly - appropriate. How many merchants do
you know that employee people who can count back change? How many
people do the math to leave a 20% tip?  </p><p>
How many things do you know that have become irrelevant?  </p>

has not obsolesced, although it is rarely used"</p>
 <p> Has the word "obsolesce" ... obsolesced?</p>
