After my brief but wonderful visit to  Dubai, I flew to Bengalaru, India, to speak at the legendary [Agile India](https://2018.agileindia.org/) 2018 edition. It was _amazing_. It was held in the beautiful Taj West End hotel, a resort in the middle of Bengalaru,  historically  called "the garden city." Naresh Jain, who runs the show, invited me to speak there.

Naresh, shown below, did me a _huge_ solid! What a wonderful event!

I got to see old friends like [_Enterprise Integration Patterns_](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/) author  [Gregor Hohpe](https://twitter.com/ghohpe)..

It seemed like every other person I spoke to knew, in some way, [of Pivotal](http://twitter.com/Pivotal) and our CEO and decades-long agile guru Rob Mee, and many even had great stories to share of their interactions with him and Pivotal (or Pivotal Labs, part of Pivotal)! There I was, in India, talking to people who worked with my company's CEO more than a decade ago. It truly is a small, wonderful, agile world.

I love India. I _love_ India. So I paid for a visa for my partner Tammie and asked her to join me for this trip. She _also_ had a wonderful time, and spent days exploring the city while I was at the show. All in all, yet another amazing trip to India for which I'm eternally grateful and which I shall not soon forget.
