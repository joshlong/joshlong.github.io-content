<p class="MsoNormal">Fantastic news! Flex has been open sourced! </p> <p class="MsoNormal">Umm, what does this mean, in effect? It means that exposing a REALLY slim, sexy client has been possible for a long time, through a lot of different concoctions, not the least of which is OpenLazlo, and&nbsp; Ajax, and thereabouts. But Flex is the nicest option for those willing to pay. It’s slick, it’s quick (VERY quick, compared to Ajax/JSON), it’s powerful (well, Java Applet powerful, not ActiveX powerful. No CD ROM drives will pop out!). And now, it’s open source. See <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex:Open_Source">Adobe Labs</a> for more.</p><p>So <i>that's</i> why James Ward <a href="http://www.jamesward.org/wordpress/2007/04/25/open-source-flex-top-10-reasons-to-rejoice/">was cooking cookies!</a>.</p><p>Congratulations, Adobe, on a very brave move.Every time a peice of mega tech emerges, my mind starts imagining what I could do with it. Each individual tool becomes "useful" and viable suddenly (isn't that atrocious? It takes it being open source for me to care?) Now, if I could only get a few dozen "open source" grids (eh, I know, I know, I'm not holding my breath), <a href="http://www.atomikos.com/products.html#ate">Atomikos Transactions</a>, <a href="http://www.springframework.org">Spring</a>, <a href="http://www.postgres.org">PostgresSQL</a>, <a href="http://terracottatech.com/">Teracotta</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Flex</a>, and a neat idea (mmm.... ebaysoftspaceazon... com)...</p><p> All that aside, <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=193593">Bruce Eckel's recently taken the Flex jump</a>, so maybe it's time to see why.</p>
