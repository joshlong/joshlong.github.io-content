<P> I've recently been playing with jBPM 4.1 and, while I haven't 
quite gotten into it, I did manage to break an Eclipse setup of my 
"old" jBPM 4.0 code. This is definitely a user error. So, trying to 
ensure I have a reproduciable baseline,  I start setting everything up 
again (I don't have the jBPM plugins or anything installed -- I keep 
it mean and lean, if possible. ) </p> <p> I got  to the point where 
everything was running fine again from the IDE, but I noticed I no 
longer had code   completion for my jBPM <code>.XSD</code> file. I'm 
not sure if I ever did, or if I did, then I've forgotten how. So, I 
stumbled through getting it working with the Eclipse Resource Catalog. 
Here are the steps to reproducing it if you have the same issue. </p> 
 <ol> <lI>  You'll need a copy of the <code>.XSD</code> itself. For 
me, the simplest option was to just download the source 
<code>jar</code> and use the <code>XSD</code> file therein. 
<code><pre>mkdir ~/xsds; cd ~/xsds ; 
wget http://repository.jboss.com/maven2/org/jbpm/jbpm4/jbpm-api/4.0/jbpm-api-4.0-sources.jar 
; 
jar xvf jbpm-api-4.0-sources.jar ; 
</pre></code> </li> <li> In Eclipse, go to Window > Preferences 
</li><li>Search for "XML Catalog," under the "XML" node.    </li> <li> 
Click "Add..." </li> <li> <li> Fill out the dialog, using the values 
below. <br/> <img src =

/> </li> </ol> <p> I hope this spares somebody some pain. Once you've 
got it working, go check out the awesome <a
