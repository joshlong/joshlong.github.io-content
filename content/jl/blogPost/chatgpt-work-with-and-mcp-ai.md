It's amazing how smart these tools are in the wake of AI. First, we saw Anthropic's Claude Desktop app (on Windows and macOS) sprout MCP last November. MCP has already enabled thousands of unique and amazing integrations and interactions on the desktop (and beyond). ([By the way, did you see my MCP video?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE1h-rC2o2U))  

Now ChatGPT has the "work with me" feature. I was sitting in IntelliJ IDEA working on some text and I switched over to ChatGPT to ask it about a phrasing or something, and I noticed a little "README.adoc" icon above the ChatGPT text input area. It _knew_ about my IDE's context!

Turns out this is a feature that was introduced a few weeks ago and is already supported across the entire fleet of JetBrains technologies!

You can check the ChatGPT desktop app's "Settings" screen to see what. It _also_ works in Apple Notes, Apple TextEdit, Apple Script Editor, and Apple's Terminal, too! 

And, if you install a plugin, it can be made to work in Visual Studio Code, too!

Nice!
