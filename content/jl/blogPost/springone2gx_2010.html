<p><a href="http://www.springone2gx.com/" border="0"> <img src = "/media/17878" style  = "float:left; margin-right:10px; " /></a>  I'll be speaking at <a href="http://www.springone2gx.com/">SpringOne2GX</a> this week along with a raft of supremely awesome speakers from the Spring and Grails communities.   I'll be delivering a talk about building custom components (mostly, custom adapters) for <a href="http://www.springsource.com/spring-integration">Spring Integration.</a>  There are other talks happening concurrently that, if I weren't giving a talk, I'd want to attend. :-) This year is poised to continue last year's agressive growth in attendance. Besides my talk, I'll be there  taking in the talks and chatting with people in the hallways.  I hope to see you there! </p>
