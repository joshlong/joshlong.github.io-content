<p>Sometimes people tell me, "Josh, you're an idiot!" Then I have myself a good cry and walk it off.
</p> <p>
 Then people ask me about the 7-node grid I keep in my home office. </p> <p>They wonder why I would keep that many computers in so small a space. They wonder, "why?"
 Besides providing something of an electric heater (the room's consistently 10F warmer than the rest of the place!), the computers let me test algorithms/concepts in scale. Frameworks like <a href="http://terracotta.org/">Teracotta</a> don't test very consistently on a single node, after all. And, of course, there's nothing like having 2TB of space exposed as one giant mount.
</p>
<p>Finally, people ask me if there are any disadvantages. They ask if the electric bill's high. It isn't, but that's a side effect of living in Arizona, where my air conditioner's on 24/7 and so an extra few computers doesn't really make a difference.

 They ask if I spend my time maintaining them.I tell them I run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu">Ubuntu</a>, so I never get viruses. If a PC malfunctions then I simply repair it and reimage the node.

 They press me. Surely there's <i>something</i> disadvantageous to running so many computers. I tell them the honest truth. It's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust">dust</a>. The dust alone is the reason I want to just invest in EC2. And of course, I'm an asthmatic <b>and</b> a green fiend. So I can't use the aerosol canisters to dispel the dust. Nor can I use the Ozone-friendly canisters -- they both trigger my asthma or offend my green sensibilities. So, I have to clean them with a rag on occasion (once every couple of weeks).

</p>

<p>Next time I get a home office, I'm going to get it with tile. Remember, if you're going to setup a grid, the biggest challenge you face may not be technical.
