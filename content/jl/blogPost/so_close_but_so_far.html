<P>
Started today pretty impressed that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/">Interoperability @ Microsoft</a>
 was a sponsor at <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org">EclipseCon, which kicked off today.</a> So, score one for community and interoperability. 
<EM>Then</EM>, I see that Microsoft is <a href="http://mobilized.allthingsd.com/20110321/microsoft-sues-barnes-noble-over-nook-alleging-its-android-use-infringes-patents/">suing Barnes & Nobles and others for their use of Android</a> in their tablet environments. 
Huh. 
They almost went an entire day without being ... <EM>Microsoft</EM>. One for the history books.
