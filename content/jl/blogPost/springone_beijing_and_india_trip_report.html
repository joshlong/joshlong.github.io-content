<p>  I  just finished <A href = "http://springonechina.cloudfoundry.com">SpringOne China</a> over the weekend. The show was absolutely amazing and the attendees were, as usual, the highlight of the show. It was such an honor to meet so many wonderful people. 
 
We <a href= "http://springonechina.cloudfoundry.com">finished SpringOne China</a> over the weekend and are today 
	at the first of two events  for  <a href="http://springoneindia.cloudfoundry.com">SpringOne India in Bangalore and SpringOne in Hyderabad</a>. 
	The shows have been really amazing! In particular, I've enjoyed  the food, the sites and the <EM>amazing</EM> community that have turned up in droves!  
 
</p> 
 <p> Tomorrow, I'll join my colleagues at the   SpringOne India Hyderabad event, the second of the two shows in India. </p>
