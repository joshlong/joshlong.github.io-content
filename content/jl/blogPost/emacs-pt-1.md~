I'm working on a new book, [_Reactive Spring_](http://ReactiveSpring.io), and in the process I'm trying to level up my `emacs`-fu. I wrote most of my last book with my buddy [Kenny Bastani](http://Twitter.com/KennyBastani), [_Cloud Native Java_](http://CloudNativeJava.io), in `emacs` and really enjoyed the process, especially having come from four other published books before that where the work was done largely in Microsoft Word, running inside a Windows Virtual Machine, running on my workhorse Linux desktop machine, a decade ago.

This time I wanted go further than just using `emacs` as a text editor with no plugins. I wanted to use some of the famed flexibility in Emacs. Today I spent a little time my with my friend [Mario Gray](http://Twitter.com/MarioGray) tweaking `emacs` then I threw everything we did away and tried to get the meaningful stuff setup again, from scratch, avoiding all the mistakes made in the first run, so that I could explain them all here.

The pre-requisite is that you're going to need to [install Melpa](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started), a repository for the Elpa package manager. That's easy. Copy-and-paste the configuration shown in that file to your `~/.emacs` file. You might have to create that file.

Once that's installed the rest is easy. You can use `M-x package-list-packages` to see all the possible packages. You should be able to find [`adoc-mode`](https://github.com/sensorflo/adoc-mode/wiki). You can install it by issuing `M-X package-install` and then specifying `adoc-mode`.

Now you can open up any file with Asciidoctor in it, issue `M-X adoc-mode` and it'll give you decent syntax highlighting. 

Next, and hear me out. I want to use `emacs` for Asciidoctor editing and I want to use it to do light refactoring of Java code. Perfectly normal. It's a natu... I SAID HEAR ME OUT! I know. But it's normal. Java code is text, last I checked. `emacs` is great with text. So, I'll let that sink in. I want to edit Java code. In `emacs`. :whistles:

Still there? My book has tons of code and I need to be able to look at the code, especially when annotating it. I don't want to have to load a whole IDE just to annotate the code for use in the book as includes in that book. `emacs` is crazy fast and purpose-built for this sort of editing so it figures I'd do that in here. But i'm not the good [Dr. Venkat Subramaniam](http://twitter.com/VenkatS). I don't write Java code without an IDE and hope to get away with it! I need the soft landing of syntax highlighting and in-editor compilation and feedback. Autocompletion would be nice too. 

Now, keep in mind I'm not planning on using `emacs` for some of the things you might think I'd use an IDE.

I'm _not_ using the IDE to format the code. That's done by the glorious [Spring Boot Java Format](https://github.com/spring-io/spring-javaformat) Maven plugin which I've configured in all my Maven projects. I  run `mvn spring-javaformat:apply` at the root of my project and it formats all my code consistently. If I _don't_ run that command, it fails the build! So I don't need to worry about tidying up in `emacs` versus Eclipse versus IntelliJ. There's only one way to get code past the CI build and that's not in `emacs`.

I'm _not_ planning on using `emacs` to do large scale refactorings (though, this `emacs` plugin does apparently support some of that. Which is nice.

All I want is syntax highlighting and the usual feedback. Tell me if something won't compile. Give me autocompletion as I type. The usual. 

This is all quite elegantly acheived with a plugin called [Meghanada](https://github.com/mopemope/meghanada-emacs). You can install it from your Elpa package manager as well. You'll need to copy-and-paste the configuration from the linked website into your `~/.emacs` file as well.

Here's my finished, working `~/.emacs` file.
