<P>    <img src="/media/17869" style = "float:left; margin-right:10px;"/> I did a webinar with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/cloudcoder">Quinton Wall</a>, the Developer Evangelist for  <a href="http://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce.com</a> and specifically on the <a href="http://www.vmforce.com">VMforce</a> collaboration. The talk went very well (thanks for all the questions and good feedback, guys!) and we have the recorded webinar, code and slides up <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/2836">here</a>. This first webinar was more about introducing developers to the Spring framework, and establishing basic skills to enable developers to use <a href="http://www.vmforce.com">VMforce.com</a>.  Stay tuned for the <a href="http://www.developerforce.com/events/getstart_vmforce_techtalk/registration.php?d=70130000000FK2U">next webinar,</a> coming Sept 9, that will expand on the details of VMForce.com as an opportunity for Spring developers. </p>
