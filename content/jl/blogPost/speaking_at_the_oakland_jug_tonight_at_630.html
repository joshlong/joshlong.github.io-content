<P>Hi guys, tonight I'll be speaking at the Oakland JUG on 
 <a href="http://www.meetup.com/eastbayjug/"><EM>Multi Client Development with Spring</EM></a>. 
 The talk will be geared towards developing modern web applications that are REST-centric using Spring, Spring MVC, Spring Android, and Spring Mobile. If we have time, we could go into even more detail on other technologies like Spring Security and Spring Security OAuth.  I hope to see you guys there as it figures to be a fun time!

 On a related note, I will have my pal <A href="http://twitter.com/andypiper">Andy Piper</a> in tow.  He's a <A href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com">Cloud Foundry</a> ninja, and I'm sure he'll have answers for people with questions!
</P>
