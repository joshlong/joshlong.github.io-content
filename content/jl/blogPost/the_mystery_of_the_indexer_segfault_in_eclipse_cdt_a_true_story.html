title=The Mystery of the Indexer Segfault in Eclipse CDT, a True Story

~~~~~~

<p>I just hit a good 'ol fashioned segfaulting bug! 
 For reasons I'm not proud of, I had cause to write some C++ code. I downloaded Eclipse CDT (And before some sadist comes along suggesting I should've stuck with vi or <a href="http://xkcd.com/378/">butterflies</a>, I've tried just about every C/C++ environment out there. I'm one of those guys that just doesn't understand writing C or C++ code without an editor. I'd sooner write Java than C or C++. Far too many things that can go wrong, it seems.) 
 
 I downloaded the latest one based on <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse Helios</a>, installed it and then created a new C++ project (<code>File</code> &gt; <code>New</code> &gt; <code>C++ Project</code> &gt; <code>Executable</code> &gt; <code>Hello World C++ Project</code>). As soon as the Eclipse indexer started churning, Eclipse suddenly just disappeared! One second, I'm looking at Eclipse, and then a blink later, I'm staring at my computer Desktop! The darned thing had segfaulted on me!  I triaged the droppings it had left just before it died - here are the salient excerpts  of the log:

<p> My many years of experience have helped me in these situations - they inform my professionalism and abiity to react decisevly and appropriately. It is imperative that one keep is cool when things don't  work out as planned. </p> 
<p>So, I sucked my thumb, all the while whimpering a little. I mean, c'mon! Somewhere in the <EM>millions</EM> of lines of Linux source code and the entire 30+ <EM>million</EM> lines of Eclipse source code was a bug, <em>actively</eM> working to ruin my day! You'd cry too if you just thought about it a little. 
</p>
<p> But I had one last defense before the false recourse of sticking Eclipse itself under a bugger (and, how I would've done that remains unclear; I couldn't very well have used Eclipse CDT to debug itself and the interactions between Eclipse CDT and the native code in the JRE!). I knew that I could ask my old pair programming pal, Google! I then started scanning looking for unique, repeatable information (i.e., something that would make a good, precise Google query.). At the bottom, I found  <b>"org.eclipse.cdt.internal.ui.text.CReconciler,"</b> and away I went! I asked The Google about any issues with that class in Eclipse CDT, and was given <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=tree&th=200460&S=02b8aad7b1bd5e0c66361e1ec1e6f92f#page_top">this Eclipse forums link</a>. That eventually led me to <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=647737">this bug report</a>. That is where I found a workaround. It didn't quite match my situation, but the <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=647737#c31">fix</a> was the same: add <CODE>-XX:-UseCompressedOops</CODE> to the end of my <code>eclipse.ini</code>.
</p>
<p>So, I hope this blog has helped you avoid this particular bug. It'll probably be fixed soon, but my pain remains. The worst part about all of this? I did <em>all that work</em> just to end up in a position where I could write C++ code! That's like... helping the Dentist look for his <em>really big</eM> drill so he can give  you a root canal! </p><p>Meh.</p>
