<p>I have a lot to be thankful for. This year   I moved back  
to Los Angeles, where I've been well received in a new job  and by 
family. I've experienced  success speaking at various conferences, and 
this year saw the publication of my first book, Apress' "Spring 
Enterprise Recipes." Recently, I was in a pretty bad accident (a 
big-rig rear-ended me) and I emerged alive.  I have made good friends. I am 
thankful for the readers of my blogs.  I am thankful for my  loving 
friends and family.</p><p>I hope you have a long list of things for 
which you're thankful, too. Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
