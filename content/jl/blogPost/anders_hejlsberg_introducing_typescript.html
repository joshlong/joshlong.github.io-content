I was in Aarhus, Denmark last week and gave my talk on using Cloud Foundry, and then spoke in the evening at the local Java User Group as a special guest, which was <EM>awesome</EM>.  The only regrettable thing was that Anders Hjelsberg was concurrently giving his talk  introducing TypeScript, which meant I couldn't see it.  So, I watched it today in the background while I was wrestling with expense reports. Check  out the link to <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Anders-Hejlsberg-Introducing-TypeScript">Microsoft's Channel 9 where you can watch the video</A>.  

 TypeScript is not the first technology to  <em>solve</EM> the static-language-to-JavaScript problem, following the most recent introduction into the  market, <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)">Google's Dart</A>. Before that, of course, we had CoffeeScript, ScriptSharp, GWT, etc. I could actually see myself using this one, though.  My one twinge of discord is that I think a lot of the complaints he identifies as inhibiting large application development (such as the  lack of strong  types) are less of a problem with a good organizational framework in place. An MVC framework like <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">backbone.js</a> or <A href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a> let you plugin the missing pieces which means that no single component is going to be so big that it might see substantial benefit by having a stronger type system, and coordination between the components is handled by the more rigorously tested framework.
