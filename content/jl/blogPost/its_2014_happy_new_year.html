<P> Just wanted to wish everyone a happy and healthy new year. I hope you spent it with family and  friends, and maybe a good piece of code on your mind.  </p>
<P>  The year's already off to a great start for me. For others, not so much. It seems that <a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2014/01/01/skypes-twitter-account-blog-get-hacked-sea-demanding-end-spying/">@Skype's Twitter account's been hacked</a>. Was sort of strange to see this series of Tweets this morning:  <br /> <img src = "/media/18790"  width = "400" /> </P>
