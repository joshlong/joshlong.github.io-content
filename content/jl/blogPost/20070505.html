<div><p>This is a little outdated, at this point, but Iâ€™m posting this just to follow through with things. </p><p>The Tapestry archetype mentioned here on this site is now officially included in the Tapestry source code, <a href="http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry4.1/tapestry-archetype/index.html">available from Apache</a>.&nbsp; The documentation is all there, and is pretty much the same thing as I discussed here, however, the incantation has (naturally) changed to reflect its new home on Apache:</p><code>mvn archetype:create -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.tapestry -DarchetypeArtifactId=tapestry-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=4.1.2-SNAPSHOT -DgroupId=org.example -DartifactId=myapp -DremoteRepositories=http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-snapshot-repository</code><p>Thanks to Jesse Kuhnert (lead Tapestry 4 developer, nice guy, <a href="http://www.nabble.com/-announce--new-goodies-for-tapestry-4.1-p10246866.html">lots of support</a>&nbsp; during the process itself) and Howard (<a href="http://tapestryjava.blogspot.com/2007/02/maven-archetype-for-tapestry-4.html">on his blog, for example</a>) for their support!</p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
