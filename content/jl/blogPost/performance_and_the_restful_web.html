<P>
 I'm going to be doing a webinar for <A href="http://www.springsource.org">SpringSource</A> on
 March 14th, 2013, called
 <A href="http://www.springsource.org/node/4033"><EM>Multi Client Development with Spring (and Spring MVC)</EM></a>. The webinar will feature an introduction to Spring MVC's basic component model, as well as the principles of <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer"><EM>REST</EM></a>.   
Once we've introduced Spring's REST support, we'll look at how to take  your application to your users by building clients that your users want to use with <A href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-mobile">Spring Mobile</a>, <A href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-android">Spring Android</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>.
 </p>
<P> Be sure to register now and bring questions, ideas, etc.  I look forward to seeing you at there, and we'll look at some of the amazing support  
 Spring offers for building best-of-breed web-centric, RESTful applications.
