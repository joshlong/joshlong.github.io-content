<P> This is a picture of <A href= "http://www.thekettle.net/">The Kettle</A> in Los Angeles' Manhattan Beach area at 4AM. So surreal. The Kettle, by the way, is an amazing restaurant that's open 24/7 in Los Angeles and situated a block away from the Pacific Ocean. Beautiful and fun during the day. Downright amazing at 3am.  <DIV style = "margin-top: 5px;" >
