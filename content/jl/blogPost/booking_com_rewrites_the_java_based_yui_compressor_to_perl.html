<p> <A href = "http://blog.booking.com/efficient-css-compression-in-perl.html">Booking.com has announced that they've re-written the Java-based YUI Compressor using Perl</a>. I'm used to seeing people talking about rewriting systems written in Java into other languages like Python, C, C#, Haskell, Erlang, Scala, Groovy, etc. If I'm honest I just haven't seen many new Perl programs except buried in people's system administration logic and, of course, <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a>.

<p> The results are impressive though, so this is very cool. And, I expect that this will make the tool more approachable to developers as Perl's still far easier and more pervasive than Java virtual machines on machines of developers who are not Java developers. So... cool!
