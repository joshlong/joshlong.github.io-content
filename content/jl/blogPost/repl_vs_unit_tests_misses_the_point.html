  An   interesting thread emerged on Twitter today regarding ways to explore a problem: <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a> or Unit tests?   <A href="https://twitter.com/mtnygard">Michael Nygard (@mtnygard)</a> said:

   <blockquote>Exploratory unit tests are a crappy REPL with a really slow response time.</blockquote>
  <P>
  This    - to mine own scripting and interpreted-language friendly ears - sounds 
  about right. 
  
  On the other hand, there's definitely an argument to be made for unit tests, which a lot of people did. To wit, <a href="http://twitter.com/judsonlester">@judsonlester</a> replied:

  
  
 </P>  <blockquote>
  Also: a REPL is a crappy unit test that requires a lot of extra typing and programmer recall.

  <P> This also makes sense! 
	  So, we've got two great perspectives offering competing views. It's important to not to get too lost in the methodology and step back from it.
	  What we have here are two competing perspectives on the <EM>same</EM> agreed upon approach: better programs result from <EM>thinking</EM> about the problem space before trying to solve it.
	  I would argue that - depending on what you're trying to do - there are a lot of valid approaches. 
	  If you're trying to build your own API that others will consume - then exploring possible arrangements in  TextMate for me is far more useful than a unit test or a REPL.
	  
	  If you're trying to explore and kick the tires on an unknown API, then a REPL (if it's available!) gives you more immediate feedback. Once you've gained some facts about the behavior of the API, codify them with a unit test.

	  This whole discussion, of course, centers around whether  or not your programming language of choice supports a REPL! I work principally on the JVM, particularly in Java and Scala. 
	  As Java has no REPL, it can be useful to drop into some other shell or language and use that. Groovy is great for this as it is a full featured (more-than fully featured) language
	  that you can interact with in a REPL and that can interface with JVM libraries.

In the same vein, years ago, there was a project called <A href="http://www.beanshell.org/"> BeanShell</a>, which provided a REPL for Java.   I confess I haven't heard much about it of late, probably due to   the prevalence of Groovy. 
	There was even <A href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=274"> a JSR (JSR 274) to advance the project</a> to a standard with the expectation that it would one day be folded into the Java platform itself.

 Anyway, I'm just thinking aloud. I thought it was an interesting thread. If you've got any thoughts, I'd love to hear about it on <A href="http://twitter.com/starbuxman">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105805020312347758498/posts">Google+</a>
