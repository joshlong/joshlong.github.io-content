I just had the privilege of visiting some customers in Minneapolis, Minnesota and while I was there I took some time to visit the compound that housed the late musician [Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_\(musician\)) 's production facilities (studios, offices, and more) and personal residence,  Prince was a musical legend and a personal hero, so it was an amazing experience to visit that place. Sadly, photos are prohibited within the compount itself, so I don't have much to share here except that you should visit the place if you have the opportunity. It's humbling. Think about it - Prince built it in the mid '80s for TEN million dollars, out in the middle of _nowhere_! The place is _massive_!
