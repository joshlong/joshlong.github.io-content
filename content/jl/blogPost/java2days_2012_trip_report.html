<p> I've just returned from one of my all-time favorite conferences, the amazing <a href="http://2012.java2days.com/">Java2Days conference in Sofia, Bulgaria</a>. This was my fourth year speaking there. I've had the unique, and rare privilege of having been there every year since the show started in <a href="https://joshlong.com/jl/blogPost/the_last_2_crazy_months.html">2009</a>. Here's my post of the show from <A href="https://joshlong.com/jl/blogPost/java2days_2010.html">2010</A>.   
	 Each year, the show gets better and better.  This year was no exception. I gave two talks - my <EM><A href="http://www.slideshare.net/joshlong/multi-client-development-with-spring-14902171">Multi Client Development with Spring MVC</a></EM> (which is mainly about  connecting clients (Android, native, HTML5) to your services with REST) and <EM><A href="http://www.slideshare.net/joshlong/the-cloud-foundry-bootcamp">The Cloud Foundry Bootcamp</a></EM>.   (Those links are to the slides on my SlideShare account, if you're interested..)

		<P>I enjoyed this year like crazy, and - as usual - can't wait until next year!
			 Thanks again to the Java2Days team for putting on such a magnificent show!

		 <P>I would be remiss if I didn't mention, in this particular instance, that I'll be <EM>back</EM> in Sofia, Bulgaria in a few weeks for the <A href="http://opentour.cloudfoundry.com/2012/sofia">Cloud Foundry Open Tour</a> event Sofia!
			If  you're in the region and want to talk Spring and  cloud computing on Cloud Foundry, the open source PaaS from VMware, then drop by and see me!
