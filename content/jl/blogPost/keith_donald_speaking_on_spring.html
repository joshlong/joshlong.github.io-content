Keith Donald's going to be at this week's <a href="http://www.phxjug.org/">Phoenix Java User Group</a> talking about Spring MVC and Spring WebFlow 2.5/2.0, respectively! I am bringing at least 3 friends, I suggest if you can make it, you should try and go. I had a weird month last month so I missed it, but I can't wait for this one!
