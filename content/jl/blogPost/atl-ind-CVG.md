I'm off to Atlanta, Indianapolis and Cincinnati this week! I'll be speaking at the [Atlanta, GA Spring Meetup on Tuesday the 10th](https://www.meetup.com/AtlantaSpring/events/244444404/) where I'll be looking about all things new, _bootiful_ and _cloud-native_ including reactive programming, Spring Web Flux, Spring Cloud Finchley, Spring Cloud Function and [Project Riff](http://ProjectRiff.io).

Then it's off [to  Indianapolis where I'll be doing the same talk](https://www.meetup.com/Indianapolis-Java-User-Group/events/248184994/) on Thursday the 12th.

I'd love to see you! Come on out!
