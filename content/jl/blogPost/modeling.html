I can't tell you how powerful overcoming the leap-before-looking 
temptation is when building a system. Have an object model? 
<b>Model</b> it using UML or ERD. Have a workflow? Draw a workflow 
diagram (an activity diagram). Have a webflow? Draw a webflow diagram 
(looks like a state diagram, or in more sophisticated scenarios, like 
an activity diagram). Have a site map? Map the site using a site 
planning tool like <a 
href="http://dub.washington.edu:2007/denim/">Denim.</a> All of these 
tools facilitate VISUAL feedback. They are cognitive, high level 
disciplines, and for good reason! Your mind interprets things visually 
differently than it does when coding from the left brain - it is able 
to "see" associations between related concepts when it's fed ideas 
through feedback that ends up in the right brain. 
</p><p> I've mentioned this before, I think, but check out Neal Ford's 
<a href="http://library.theserverside.com/detail/RES/1242309506_447.html">On 
the Lam From The Software Police</a> for more. 
</p><p>Even if you don't check it out, invest in trying the modeling 
tools associated with the task you're attempting to solve. 
 Even if you feel - after giving the technology a REALLY good-faith 
effort - that you've gained nothing, I'm willing to bet your product 
will still be more "consistent" than if you had developed it from 
scatch, unable to see the big picture.
