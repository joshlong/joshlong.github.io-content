I was there last year and quite enjoyed the conference. What a wonderful group! I'll be copresenting two talks with Oleg Zhurakousky (we'll be talking about <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration">Spring Integration 2</a> as well as RabbitMQ and AMQP), and another with <a href="http://www.jamesward.com/">James Ward</a> (we'll be talking about Spring BlazeDS and Flex, naturally). Finally, I'll be giving another presentation  on using Spring and the Apache 2 licensed BPMN 2 solution <a href="http://www.activiti.org">Activiti</a> (simialar to the talk I gave at  <a href="http://jz10.java.no/">JavaZone</a> recently).  Java2Days is the only conference of its kind in the Balkans and I sincerely hope to see you there!  </p>
