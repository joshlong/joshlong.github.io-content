[CloudFoundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) is the leading on-prem Platform-as-a-Service. It's been designed from the ground up to allow organizations to deliver value - software, systems, and services - into production with ease. As a Spring developer, it's a natural fit and this is your must-watch introduction to going to production with Cloud Foundry. 
Cloud Foundry is the opensource foundation for some enterprise leading platform-as-a-service offerings [like Tanzu Application Service (TAS)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/index.html).
I put together this video with cloud infrastructure legend [Josh McKenty](https://twitter.com/jmckenty) (creator of OpenStack, among other things) so that you could get the operator's experience  _and_ the developer's experience for building cloud native applications with Spring Boot on an industry leading platform-as-a-service.
