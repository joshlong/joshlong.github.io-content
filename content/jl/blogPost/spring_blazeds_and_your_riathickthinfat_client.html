<p>  How are you handling messaging in your thin client, thick client, 
fat client, RIA, or mobile client?  </p><p> <a 
href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/blazeds/BlazeDS">BlazeDS</a> 
provides the ability to  proxy   messages from a JMS destination. Your 
AIR / Flex client can subscribe to it and provide a callback, very 
much like a Message Driven EJB or Spring's Message Driven POJOs. </p> 
<p>Traditionally, reacting to an event on a bus in a client (which 
very well could exist outside the firewall) means polling some service 
or setting up a specialized proxy or perhaps having  separate DMZ-safe 
JMS destination where you forward client-bound messages. 
</p><p>Suffice it to say, all of this is tedious and imposes an 
unecessary burden on the architecture and the developers. When it 
comes to messaging and remoting based services, there is 
<i>definitely</i> an extra burden on the developer of a RIA to secure 
or handle that requirement where this burden simply does not exist 
with traditional web applications. It is too frequently glossed over 
when architecting a system and then becomes a pain point. </p><p> 
There are <i>some</i> tools... </p><p>If you are using AJAX for your 
RIA, then you will have mastered tools like comet for push-based 
messaging. Even here, though, the burden of connecting and configuring 
comet is on you, the developer. For example, <a 
href="http://directwebremoting.org/dwr/index.html">DWR</a> - which is 
fantastic - doesn't have a way of proxying a JMS destination that I 
know of. It <i>can</i> be done, of course.</p><p><a 
href="http://www.dossot.net/">David Dossot</a> showed me a very 
interersting, albeit specific, <a 
href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Integrating%20with%20ActiveMQ">solution</a> 
that solves the problem for Ajax using ActiveMQ's JavaScript client. 
</p> 
<p> So, back to the question at hand - how are you solving the 
problem? Do you just avoid building systems that have the problem? You 
truly can't think of at least one or two or a millino problems that 
would be better served by messaging? </p> 
<p> To me, the most <b>complete</b> solution appears to be Flex 
partnered with Spring and BlazeDS. If this post sounds like that of a 
gushing fan boy, you'll forgive me. It's true, unbounded enthusiasm. 
This technology is liberating, enabling! It reduces a real problem to 
a half hour of configuration - relegating the architectural burden 
back to the "gloss over" column, if you're using Flex. The Spring - 
BlazeDS integration is more than just a lot of "could"s. It provides 
out-of-the box support for connecting to JMS, and if you use the 
<b>excellent</b> <a 
href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-flex">Spring/BlazeDS</a> 
solution, then you can do all of this with  aplomb, and you can  hook 
up any flex client to any channel on your Spring Integration bus with 
a minimum of fuss. 
  </p> <p>Naturally, all of that will all be covered in <a 
href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430224991">Spring Web 
Recipes</a>, so stay tuned! </p><p> 
So: how are <b>you</b> talking to your messaging middleware?  Remember 
- messaging is even MORE important in the wild Web 2.0 / cloud world 
than the client-server applications of yesteryear. Temporal decoupling 
brings scalability.
