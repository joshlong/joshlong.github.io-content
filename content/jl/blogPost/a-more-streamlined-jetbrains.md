I just stumbled upon a few nice settings in the `Settings` menu in IntelliJ IDEA and WebStorm. I imagine, but haven't confirmed, that they're also available in other Jetbrains products. These settings make the IDE a bit more, ehm, compact. Let's take a look at them.

Here's the IDE after the changes have been applied.

Not a huge difference, but quite a bit nicer. I quite like how svelte the Project view is. Means I can keep the panel open while also not wishing I had more space on a laptop.

And here's the settings I clicked to get the effect:

Nice! Maybe these have been here for 20 years and I simply never noticed. But I quite like them. Well done, as always, Jetbrains!
