<p> I have been super sick these last two days. 
 I ate some bad alcohol or food in my new year's eve celebrations and paid for it by spending the last two days in the bathroom. It has been <em>ugly</em>! 

  </p><P> On the upside, I've lost a lot of weight and I've been  super productive! Submitted for 3 conferences, replied to a backlog of holiday emails, caught up on some reading, setup VPN for my Android phone and iPad thanks to boxpn.com, caught up with amazing people I haven't talked to in a while (owing in part to usual neglect of, and - as I've been sick - my sudden reinterest in) Facebook, started writing some pages on this chapter I've been working on for my next book (Manning's Cloud Foundry in Action), and more!
 In short: I recommend people take more sick days if they want to catch up on work.
