A couple of years ago, my beloved Shiftit application stopped doing the right thing. Shiftit, if you don't know, is a window manager that gives me keybindings to move windwos around on macOS. It's a treasure, and gives me the kind of window management I'd become accustomed to in Linux and even -_gasp_!- Windows. 

Unfortunately, it died. No idea why. But my friend and yours Matt Raible discovered an alternative some years ago that I quite like: Hammerspoon. 

He wrote a great blog post about it, which I linked to in early 2022. Unfortunately that configuration no longer works, either. So, here instead are the even easier, known-to-work-on-a-fresh-macOS-installation, steps for the  configuration I'm rocking now.  

* install Hammerspoon: `brew install --cask hammerspoon`
* then install the Spoon (a "plugin" for Hammerspoon) called [`hammerspoon-shiftit`](https://github.com/peterklijn/hammerspoon-shiftit#spooninstall)
* there are three steps described in the `README.md`: follow them! Now you don't need Matt's genius configuration
