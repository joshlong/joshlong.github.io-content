	Hey guys, are you going to be at JFokus' <a href = "http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/page.jsp?lang=en&id=tutorial">University day tomorrow</A>? Come see <a href = "http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/speaker/chris_richardson">Chris Richardson</A> and <a href = "http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/speaker/josh_long">I</a> talk about building better Spring applications on Cloud Foundry at 9AM tomorrow morning. 
 
 If you're in Helsinki, might I recommend  <a href = "https://vaadin.com/meetup/jfokus-2012">the JFokus with Vaadin</A> cruise which leaves from Helsinki aboard the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Silja_Symphony">MS Silja Symphony</A> at 17:00 EET, and then works it way to Stockholm, where of course you're then free to attend JFokus. I'll be there, giving a talk on getting to production quicker with technologies like <a href = "http://www.cloudfoundry.org">Cloud Foundry</A>, <A href = "http://www.springframework.org">Spring</A> and <A href = "http://www.vaadin.com">Vaadin</A>. The deck from the  <a href = "http://www.slideshare.net/joshlong/cf-vaadin">talk from the Vaadin dev meetup on Spring, Roo and Vaadin  is available</A>, and so is the  deck from the <a href= "http://www.slideshare.net/joshlong/a-running-tour-of-cloud-foundry">JFokus Cloud Foundry quickie is available here</a>.
