<p> If you've been following <a href= "http://www.twitter.com/starbuxman">my tweets</a> in the last two months, you know I've been bouncing around India and China.  Actually, in China, you would've noticed the <EM>lack</EM> of tweets, as Twitter's blocked there. 
	
	</P> 
	
	<P>  I went to India early in August to visit system integrators and talk to them about the about the promise and potential <a href = "http://www.cloudfoundry.org">of Cloud Foundry, the Open Source PaaS from VMWare</a>.  
		
		
 System integrators are the   first frontier - these guys are often 50,000+ employees   strong and service  customers all around the world! It's no surprise that they would want to know about a on-premise, open source solution  like Cloud Foundry! 
	 The feedback and enthusiasm there is very exciting, and - of course - there is a huge story for support for Spring in the cloud, which they wanted as well. 
	
	</p> 
	 <P> Then, I went to various cities in China on a mini-tour. I visited Shenzhen, China (for the <a href ="http://www.archsummit.com/">InfoQ ArchSummit conference</a>), where I gave a keynote lecture to a thousand enigmatic developers with simultaneous translation.  My colleagues from VMWare Shanghai  were there and gave a few talks on Cloud Foundry as well. The reception was, as you can imagine, very good. I am particularly grateful for my VMWare colleagues, who sort of played tour guide for me while I was there. There can be no  doubt - the Chinese are learning English. It is part of the country, now. But not all speak it conversantly, and so I really appreciated the help. I got pretty good at charades, though!   Then, it was off to Nanjing, China where I gave a talk  introducing Cloud Foundry to the <EM>amazingly</em> enthusiastic developers at <a href ="">OSChina</A>.  At one point the air conditioning died and the room was left - 200+ people and packed! - in a sweltering standing heat.  <EM>I</EM> would've left!  I was 
		<EM>shocked</EM> no one else did, and it was really gratifying to be able to talk to them. I know they weren't comfortable, but the content from all the speakers was good, and the developers were the kind of people all conferences want: inspired, passionate. 
		
		Truly inspiring.  I imagine I walked away from the conference as inspired as anybody. 
		 
		</p> <P>
			  Finally, I went back to Shanghai to speak at an all but impromptu Spring and Cloud Foundry meetup. A few dozen developers gathered around and I gave my <EM><a href = "http://www.slideshare.net/joshlong/sawt/">Spring, a Walking Tour</a></EM>.
		</P>
		<P> I'd been to India before, (three times this single year, at this point!), so while I was very happy to be there, I was particularly enamored with my trip to China. I feel humbled and, as  with China, feel like I made some real friends. 
			 </P>
		<P>  I really enjoyed my time in both India and China, and look forward to my next occasions to visit there!
