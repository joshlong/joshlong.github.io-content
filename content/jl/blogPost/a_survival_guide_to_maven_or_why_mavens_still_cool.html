<h2>The Problem: Confusion</h2> <P> I've had a lot of small 
discussions recently with people where they were just absolutely not 
interested in using Maven. Has it somehow gotten a bad reputation when 
I wasn't looking? Am I missing something? When did I suddenly become 
the guy using a tool that was too slow, or not agile enough for 
everybody? I can still sing and dance and jump like you guys, too! 
Even if I do use Maven... </P><P>So, let old Josh tell you a little 
bit about Maven. Maybe we're not all talking about the same thing. 
Consider this a survival guide to Maven. </P><P> Maven, like this 
guide, assumes you're trying to solve the 80% cases effectively. 
Already, we have a point of confusion! </P><P> I'm pretty confident 
that your first thoughts on that last sentence were to what Maven 
considers "80%," and you're probably wondering what you might 
reasonably call Ant's "80%" cases. I would argue that Maven's "80%" 
is 80% of a much, much bigger pie. </P><P> I haven't met an Ant build 
yet that couldn't be cut down in complexity by using Maven. Sure, 
sometimes the resulting Maven <code>pom.xml</code> was more verbose 
(though, that doesn't happen all that often in practice, either), but 
that's not the same as complexity. Intrinsic complexity is one thing. 
Surface complexity is another. I define intrinsic complexity as the 
concepts required to effectively deal with a problem in a problem 
space. I define apparent complexity as the busy work a process 
presents you with to obtain a goal. </P><P> I'm pretty convinced Ant 
suffers from both of those kinds of complexities. I wasn't going to 
start any bar fights about it, but I was pretty sure. Then, Ruby On 
Rails debuted and made code generation popular again. It brought 
"convention over configuration" to the mainstream. Then, I knew I was 
on to something with Maven. </P><P> I might argue that when you 
download Ant and decide to keep it in your tool chain, you think of it 
as providing a solution, assuming you've configured it, to: 
</P><OL><LI> compiling Java source files into classes </LI><LI> 
copying resources to the right place, such as .XML files, .properties 
files, etc. </LI><LI> generating .jar or .war artifacts from the 
aforementioned classes. </LI><LI> generating JavaDocs. I'm adding this 
one as a "maybe." Does anybody still do this and actually keep 
JavaDocs floating around? Is the Eclipse or IntelliJ support for 
rendering in-popup the contents of the JavaDoc not enough? </LI></OL> 
<P>The enlightened Ant user will also, maybe, add dependency 
management with Ivy to Ant's 80% cases. I mention this to be fair, 
though I highly doubt it's that common. I suspect that a lot of Ant 
users  would still relegate that to the fringe 20% cases. </P> <p> 
Alright, so we have our 80%. Most people have a sample ant build.xml 
that they've lugged around and, when it's time to seed a new project, 
they plop it into place and it's got some variables that need to be 
replaced and then it does most of the things above. Except JavaDocs 
and Ivy. I'd be surprised, anyway. </p><p> Maven's got all of those 
features - right out of the box - in 5 lines of XML and a standard 
directory structure. This is where it stops being a fair fight. 
   No matter how much you tug or pull against that list above, chances 
are you're <i>at least</i> going to use Ant to compile. No way around 
it. Even the simplest Ant configuration requires more exertion to 
acheive that than Maven does. This point, and this point alone, is why 
I'm just not convinced people are taking a look at this and 
understanding it. If the goal is simplicity, then there's nothing 
simpler than <i>nothing</i>.  If you've had to put even a moment's 
care into that list above, than you've already wasted time and could 
have been using Maven. 
</p> <p> Now that I've gotten the soap-box speech out of the way, 
read on to understand a little bit about it, including how to set it 
up to do all the things in that list (and hundreds of other things) 
with a few directories and a 5-6 line XML file (the 5-6 lines comes 
from my formatting. It could easily be 3 lines of XML, if we're 
honest. </p><h2>Things To Know</h2> <p> <b> Where Can I get Maven? 
</b> Maven is freely available, just like Ant, <a 
href="http://maven.apache.org/">from Apache</a>. Alternatively, many 
distributions have it in their repositories. For Ubuntu, it's 
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install maven2</code></pre> This version, as 
with all repository packages, is slightly out of date. But, at least 
you're off and running.</p> 
<p> <b> How Do I Install Maven?</b> The simplest way is, like Ant, to 
unzip it, and add the <code>bin</code> folder of the directory to your 
system's <code>PATH</code> variable. Alternatively, skip to the next 
question and simply use your operating system's repository to install 
it, if possible. </p> 
<p> <b> How Do I Build a Maven Project</b> Building a Maven project 
is easy, as the command never changes. <pre><code>mvn 
install</code></pre> 
This is true whether it's your project or somebody elses. It's 
predictable, and consistant. 
To use it, ascend to the highest directory in the directory tree that 
contains a <code>pom.xml</code> file. That's usually the parent 
project. Usually, Maven projects cascade downwards, so you might try 
issuing:<pre><code>mvn install</code></pre> This will generate a 
<code>target</code> directory in each project (if there are any). 
Inspect the <code>target</code> directory for your <code>.jar</code> 
or <code>.war</code>, or whatever you're expecting. 
If for some reason there's no <code>target</code> directory in the 
directory that contains the source code you're trying to build, 
descend into it to the point where you're adjacent to the 
<code>pom.xml</code>. Then, issue again: <pre><code>mvn 
install</code></pre> 
</p> 
<p><b>How Do I Bootstrap a New Maven Project </b> The simplest setup 
requires the creation of directories as well as one XML file. But, 
you'd likely create these directories and at least one XML file with 
Ant, too. 
</p><p>Run the following on the command line. NB: I haven't translated 
for Windows. I'm sure it's easy enough, there, too. 
<PRE><code>mkdir -p 
<b>myproject</b>/src/{main,test}/{java,resources}</code></PRE> 
You can change <b>myproject</b> to whatever you want. 
This will create a directory structure like the following: 
<PRE><CODE>jlong@studio:~/Desktop/myproject$ find . 
. 
./src 
./src/main 
./src/main/resources 
./src/main/java 
./src/test 
./src/test/resources 
./src/test/java 
</CODE></PRE> 
If you're just getting started and aren't test-driven, then you can 
ignore <code>src/test/*</code>. 
That leaves you with <code>src/main/{resources,java}</code>. 
Java code goes in <code>src/main/java</code>. Things you'd like on the 
classpath of the same artifact, such as Spring application contexts, 
go in <code>src/main/resources.</code> 
</p> 
<p> Finally, you're going to need an XML POM file. POM standards for 
"Project Object Model," I think. 
It's the sole center for configuration related to your project. No 
need to do includes, or externalized configuration or anything. 
The simplest <code>pom.xml</code> looks like: 
<pre><code>&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" 
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 
http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd"&gt; 
 &lt;modelVersion>4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt; 
 &lt;groupId>com.yourproject.crm&lt;/groupId&gt; 
 &lt;artifactId>utilities&lt;/artifactId&gt; 
 &lt;version>1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt; 
&lt;/project&gt; 
</code></pre>You can copy and paste that into a file called 
<code>pom.xml</code>, at the root of the <code>myproject</code> folder 
created above. You're done. 
</p><p>From here, so long as you're just planning on using the JDK, 
etc, then this will work fine.  </p> 
<p><b>What do those directories and 5 lines of XML buy me?</b> 
Think of that as being equivalent to hundreds of Ant targets. The 
project already has enough information to, among other things: 
<ol><li>Generate javadocs: <code>mvn javadoc:javadoc</code></li> 
<li>Compile classes: <code>mvn compile </code></li> 
<li>Compile and generate an artifact (a <code>.jar</code>, in this 
case): <code>mvn install </code></li> 
<li>Generate a Checkstyle report: <code>mvn 
checkstyle:checkstyle</code></li> 
<li>Or, in the alternative (and perhaps a complement): generate a PMD 
report: <code>mvn pmd:pmd</code></li> 
<li>Build a web site with documentation on the structure of the 
project (anemic thing that it is): <code>mvn site</code></li> 
<li>Build a cross reference of the project's sources: <code>mvn 
jxr:jxr</code> </li> 
<li>Setup project files for your favorite IDEs: <code>mvn 
eclipse:eclipse</code>, or <code>mvn idea:idea</code> (<b>NB:</b> if 
you're using <a href="http://www.intellij.com/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> 7 or 
later, or <a href="http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/">Eclipse with the 
fabulous m2Eclipse plugin</a>, then you don't need these plugins. You 
can simply 'open' the project as you would any project by importing or 
opening the <code>pom.xml</code>. <a 
href="http://www.netbeans.org/">Netbeans</a> also has incredible 
support for opening Maven projects directly. </li> </ol> 
</p><p> <b>How Do I Add JARs to the ClassPath? </b> Short answer: you 
don't. You let Maven handle it for you. 
If you need a <code>.jar</code>, more than likely, it's already 
available in some repository, in the same way that a package might be 
provisioned by an operating system (such as Windows Update on Windows, 
<code>apt</code> on Debian distributions, <code>rpm</code> on RedHat 
distributions, <code>port</code> on OSX, etc..). For Maven, using a 
depdendency is as simple as identifying it and adding the metadata to 
the <code>pom.xml</code>. </p><p> There are many ways to "find" a 
<code>.jar</code>. The simplest is to start browsing <a 
href="http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven2/">a central 
repository</a> and opening the <code>pom.xml</code> files. To add a 
dependency, you need it's <code>&lt;artifactId&gt;</code>, its 
<code>&lt;version&gt;</code>, and its <code>&lt;groupId&gt;</code>. 
These elements are usually at the top of all <code>pom.xml</code>s. To 
add a dependency on the <a 
href="http://commons.apache.org/lang/">Apache Commons Lang</a> library 
to our project above, add the following lines to your 
<code>pom.xml</code>, right before the closing &lt;project&gt; 
element: 
<pre><code>&lt;dependencies&gt; &lt;!-- plenty of room to add 
dependencies --&gt;&lt;/dependencies&gt;</code></pre> 
Inside the <code>dependencies</code> section, you will add all your 
dependency information. The information you enter could be that for a 
third party <code>.jar</code>, or a <code>.jar</code> in your own 
project. Perhaps one team's project depends on another's. If Maven 
can't find the cached version of the <code>.jar</code>, it'll download 
it for you. 
<pre><code> &lt;dependency&gt;&lt;groupId&gt;<b>commons-lang</b>&lt;/groupId&gt;&lt;artifactId&gt;<b>commons-lang</b>&lt;/artifactId&gt;&lt;version&gt;<b>2.4</b>&lt;/version&gt;&lt;/dependency&gt; 
</code></pre> 
</p> <p> To test, simply rebuild it as before: <code>mvn 
install</code>. Most of the IDE integrations will have suport for 
updating the project configuration in the IDE (i.e., the classpath) 
according to what's in Maven's configuration. If you'd rather not 
spelunk through the <code>ibiblio</code> repository site, you can 
always use one of the many Maven repository indexes. A good one is <a 
href="http://search.mvnsearch.org">Maven Search</a>. Type in a 
fragment of what you're looking for and it'll provide you with 
matches. Thus: I entered "commons-lang" and it found <a 
href="http://search.mvnsearch.org/query.action?cat=jar&q=commons-lang">results</a>. 
Additionally, most of the IDE's will have support for some form of 
repository browsing.</p> 
<p><b>I'm Test Driven!</b> 
This one's easy. If you <i>do</i> want to use JUnit (or TestNG), then 
fret not - that's Maven's default M.O.! By default, any JUnit classes 
put into the <code>src/test/java</code> folder will be compiled and 
run before proceeding with the build. 
</p><h2> The Tour's Over, What Did You Think?</h2><p> In this guide, 
I've given a walk through to the questions I can imagine thinking 
about when setting up a project with Ant. The result is that you can 
get a LONG ways with nothing (the minimal <code>pom.xml</code>). 
</p><p> The balance of a given effort is the 20% stuff. As they say, 
the 20% cases can take 80% of the time. I can't speak to whether this 
is true or not as Maven's never delayed me, for any particular length, 
except when I was pushing it to do stuff that nothing else, including 
Ant, could have done. 
Even so, if you hit the 20% cases, you can rest easy in the knowledge 
that Maven is built to be flexible and extendable. It's whole model is 
exposed as a lifecycle. If you want to inject custom logic at a custom 
point, doing so is easy. It's also insanely interoperable. In fact, 
even if you don't want to use Maven but wan't to get a very high 
quality build script, setup the project using Maven and then use 
<code>mvn ant:ant</code>. It'll generate an ant script that'll handle 
most things you'd want to do. Finally, if you decide you absolutely 
can't live without, or translate effectively, an Ant script, there's 
good support for running Ant scriptlets inside of Maven. 
</p><p> Go ahead and give it a try if you haven't tried it before or 
if you were put off. It's truly powerful. The most visible testament 
to this are the ideas (like Ivy) that are inspired by it in Ant.
