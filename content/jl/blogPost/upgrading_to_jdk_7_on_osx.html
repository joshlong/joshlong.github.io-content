 I just made the jump to JDK 7 on OSX. I know, I know, I'm <EM>very</EM> behind, but when it comes to JDK iterations, I'm always a little behind. I guess I'm just more cowardly as I age... :)
 Anyway, just made the jump. This is the first release of Java on OSX that Oracle - and <EM>not</EM> Apple - is supporitng.  To make it happen, simply grab the OSX JDK from <A href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">the Oracle Java SE Development Kit 7 Downloads</a> page.  
  Once it's downloaded, double click the downloaded bundle and just follow the prompt.. there might have been two prompts, but I'd be surprised if there was, it went so quickly! 
 </p>
 <P> When it's installed, you should just be able to confirm the upgrade by going to the shell and typing <CODE>java -version</CODE>. Interestingly, I didn't even need to reload my shell to see the new version. It all just worked! Nicely done, Oracle (for once)!

<P><b>Update</b> if, for example, you wanted to remove JDK 7, <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-57423014-263/how-to-install-and-uninstall-java-7-for-os-x/">this article might help</a>.
