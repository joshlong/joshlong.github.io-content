<p>Many languages have a sense of &quot;idiomatic&quot; code: code that embraces the norms of that language. These idioms can often reflect the opinions of the language themselves: functional vs. object oriented vs. imperative, etc. </p>

<p>Java, on the other hand, debuted more as a simpler version of existing norms, rather than an opinion motivating people in any one direction. I would argue that - aside from understanding basics like JavaBean properties and what <code>equals</code>, <code>hashCode</code> and <code>toString</code> do - there&#39;s very little to &quot;idiomatic&quot; Java code, except perhaps compliance with Java style. </p>

<p>There have been many texts published over the years espousing Java style. Compliance with Java style will make your code imminently more readable to 99% of the Java community. Sun / Oracle have published several documents over the years espousing good guidelines for code names and conventions. <a href="http://www.ontko.com/java/java_coding_standards.html">This directory has a good listing of several style guides</a>. I&#39;d definitely recommend taking a look at the first two guides, in particular.</p>

<p>If you want <em>very</em> well structured code, then I can recommend no finer a guide than the Spring framework code itself. Here&#39;s <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2008/01/episode-82-organization-of-large-code-bases-with-juergen-hoeller">a great podcast on some of the lengths Spring framework lead Juergen Hoeller has gone to over the years to ensure clean, well structured code</a> (code that, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware, has stood the test of time and remained utterly and completely backwards compatible for more than a decade!). The Spring framework is legendary for having a REALLY great codebase. It routinely scores high on code quality tests. It&#39;s actually won awards at various conferences. This is because <a href="http://blog.springsource.org/author/juergenh/">Juergen Hoeller</a>, lead of the Spring framework, is notorious for ensuring a VERY consistent look and feel to the Spring framework. <em>ALL</em> the Spring projects follow his basic style and approach. That&#39;s why they&#39;re so easy to get started with, because they all look and feel consistent. In fact, Juergen&#39;s discipline is so famous that the act of having your code torn to shreds and rebuilt in a stylistically more consistent way is known as <em>Juergenization</em>. </p>

<p>My colleague Oliver Gierke also has a <a href="http://www.olivergierke.de/2013/03/juergenized/">great post on this anomaly, as well as a proper definition on his blog</a>. </p>
