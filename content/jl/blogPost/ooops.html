<p>Today started off nice enough...
I went to <a href="http://www.malibuseafood.com/">Malibu Seafood</a>
today and enjoyed a lovely day on the beach and came back to check my
blogs and, <b>blam!</b> mistake-in-the-face! </p>

<p>In my last blog I discussed that I'd updated the software powering
this blog, and that there might be some bugs to work out. </p><p>Boy,
am was I on the money on that one! Turns out, I updated the logic used
to implement my RSS feed and Atom feed (eh, mainly, the switch - I'm
embarrassed to admit - was to actually use the token that ROME expects
to generate an Atom feed instead of the RSS 2.0 type of feed.)
Bluntly: if you subscribed to my Atom feed, you only got an RSS feed,
because I fat fingered the <code>'feedType'</code> parameter on that
one!
</p>
<p> Apologies to all those were spammed this morning with 'duplicate'
(essentially) blog entries! Everything except this and the one before
it are old and can be marked as read... thanks. </p>
