 Are you  going to be in Antwerp, Beglium for Devoxx? If so, feel free to reach out to me. I'll be speaking on <A href = "http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Josh+Long">Spring (including a look at Spring 3.1 and 3.2)</A>, Cloud Foundry, and much more. 

This will be my third year at Devoxx and, as usual, I'd love to grab a beer (or two!)
    and chat with anybody and everybody about Spring, Cloud Foundry,  big data, the cloud and much more.   Also, feel free to ping me on <A href= "http://www.twitter.com/starbuxman">@starbuxman on Twitter</A>.

 Last year was an amazing event for me. I was very sick and gave 5 talks, but still had a heck of a lot of fun. This year I expect I'm feeling great (I'm in Sofia, Bulgaria, at the moment and will head to Antwerp tomorrow), and I only have 3 talks, so it should be a very relaxing, entertaining trip indeed. As usual, SpringSource and Cloud Foundry will have a booth, as well. So feel free to drop by - I'm sure you'll find me there, as well.
