<P>  <IMG src = "/media/17884" style = " float:left;margin-right:10px;" /> Steve Mayzak and I have just finished a book for O'REILLY, <EM><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920020981">Getting Started with Spring Roo.</A></EM> The book's a very quick introduction to Spring Roo, and includes information about the many useful addons (including support for <B>Vaadin</B> - a powerful, alternative web framework, and <B>Neo4j</B> - an alternative, powerful NOSQL data-store), as well as the in-built Spring Roo addons. If you're interested in Spring Roo, I hope you'll check this out.
