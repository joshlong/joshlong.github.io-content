Dear Lazy Webs, 
<br />
I just had to unplug my secondary monitor and follow <a href="http://www.leonamarant.com/2008/04/02/how-to-get-off-screen-windows-back-on-your-mac-os-x-v105/">the procedure outlined here</a> to get a wayward OSX window back on  my display.
</p> 
<p>Is there a better way?</p>
