I had the privilege of meeting with the master of messages, Confluent CEO and Kafka-creator Jay Kreps to talk to him about the Spring ecosystem and its support for Kafka and to talk to him about what I think of as one of the most exciting things to happen to the cloud, Confluent's hosted, managed, and [ready-to-scale Kafka service](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/).

There's a lot of great opportunities for Spring developers working with Apache Kafka.  [Spring for Apache  Kafka](https://projects.spring.io/spring-kafka/) provides the base integration for Spring developers wanting to work with Apache Kafka, [Spring Integration supports for Apache Kafka](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-kafka) provides inbound and outbound adapters and messaging gateways for the Spring Integration EAI framework.  [Spring Cloud Stream provides binders for Apache Kafka](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/) that make a matter of configuration and convention the connection between one microservice and another as connected through a messaging technology like Apache Kafka.   [Spring Cloud Data Flow supports easy coordination and orchestration of messaging pipelines using Apache Kafka](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/). There's a lot there! If you don't know where to start, it's my humble opinion that you should choose Spring Cloud Stream. Indeed, you can [go the Spring Initializr](http://start.spring.io) and generate a new project that's ready to go!

I learned a lot and can't wait to talk to more people about all things Kafka.
