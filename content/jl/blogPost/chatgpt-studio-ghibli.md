ChatGPT just announced a new feature that allows you to upload a photo or other reference and then have it re-render that image in another style. And it will, quite handily, do so in the style of tons of different cartoons and comic book artists. What's interesting to me is that it won't render art in the style of still-living comic book artists, only those that have (sadly) passed on. It _will_ however render things in the style of well-known anime studios whose body of work, and their style, in turn  owe to a single (often still living) creator. Bizarre.

Anyway, I took my canonical [photo](https://api.joshlong.com/media/josh-1.jpg) that I use when appearing at conferences and had it re-render it in various styles. Here they are:


###  Lego Movies

This image is rendered in the style of one of the many amazing Lego movies.

###  Frank Frazetta

This image is rendered in Frank Frazetta's style. Frank was known for the lush and surreal pieces often seen in fantasty and sci-fi graphic novels. His work looks almost vaguely photographic.

###   Jack Kirby

This image is rendered in the style of Jack-the king-Kirby. Jack Kirby, of course, is the second most important name associated with the creation of the modern comic book universes at both Marvel and DC. Stan Lee worked extensively with Jack Kirby and Kirby had a hand at creating the visual iconography and style and early incarnations of most of the big names you might know today.

###  John Buscema

This image is rendered in John Buscema-style. John's a wildly popular, though less so than someone like Jack Kirby, artist credited with so much of what would become the Marvel "house style" in the 60's, 70's, and early 80's.

###  Southpark

This image is rendered in the style of the Southpark cartoon.

###  Dragon Ball Z 

This image is rendered in Dragon Ball Z-style. I'm a little disappointed it didn't render me going super saiyan! (Maybe because my hair is already (dirty-)blonde?)

Akira Toriyama, the much beloved artist and creator of Dragon Ball Z just passed away. I wonder if ChatGPT would've let me render the image in his style, specifically? 


###  Studio Ghibli

And you _knew_ this one was comin'! This image is rendered in.. Studio Ghibli-style!
