<P> What a ridiculous blur of insanely fun travel and technology. </P>
<P> I spoke at <A HREF= "http://www.10gen.com/events/mongo-chicago-2011">the MongoDB Chicago conference</A> on the 18th of October on using
  MongoDB with <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data">Spring Data</a> Document on <a href= "http://www.cloudfoundry.org">Cloud Foundry</A>.

  This was a fantastic event and the response seemed enthusiastic about the cloud and, of course, Cloud Foundry. After all, Cloud Foundry was among the first (<em>the</EM> first?) major PaaS players to bring MongoDB to market.

  On a related note, I'm honored to say that I'll be giving the same talk (basically) at <A href= "http://www.10gen.com/events/mongo-seattle-2011">Mongo Seattle, on December 1</A>. If you're in Seattle, and want to grab a beer (or coffee!), then ping me on <A href= "http://twitter.com/starbuxman">Twitter</a> or on <A href = "https://plus.google.com/105805020312347758498/posts">Google+</A>.
  Naturally, you could always just come to the Mongo Seattle event - $100 for a fully day of talks from experts in the field is <EM>amazingly</EM> good deal (and, at this point, an ideal holiday gift!). </P>
<P> That was October 18th. I flew home, caught my breath, and then <em>flew back</EM> to Chicago for <a href= "http://www.SpringOne2GX.com">SpringOne2GX</a>, which I blogged about <A href= "https://joshlong.com/jl/blogPost/springone2gx_2011.html">recently</A>.

  SpringOne2GX  was <EM>amazing</EM>.
  I ended up doing not only the three talks I blogged about before, but an impromptu joint session with Roy Clarkson on HTML5 mobile application development. The whole conference is something not to be missed. What an absolutely amazing show filled with amazing people.</P>

 <P>
  I returned home just long enough to get a fresh load of laundry and then set back out to Sofia, Bulgaria, for one of my absolute favorite conferences, <a href= "http://java2days.com">Java2Days</a>.

  The conference, in South East Europe, is at the nexus of Greece, Turkey, Italy, Armenia, etc., so it attracts a <EM>lot</EM> of people who are really enthusiastic about the conference and the technology.

 <P>
  The conference itself is unrivaled, of course, but the real draw is the chance you have to meet and greet and to take in the culture. Pack your stomach pump, though, the <em><a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakia">rakia</a></em> (and the fraternizing, dancing and fun that accompanies it!)  tends to sneak up on you!

  I was at dinner on with  the other speakers and with attendees from the show and in walks <EM>Jean Claude van Damme</EM> who was in town, apparently, shooting the <a href="http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=133389"><em>Expendables 2</em></a>. He sat down, celebrated a bit and was even kind enough to indulge me in a photo, which I proudly post here. <EM>Merci, Jean-Claude!</EM>
 </P>

 <P>  I returned home on the 6th - giving me just enough time to get  a small flu and to prepare my decks for <a href= "http://devoxx.com/display/DV11/Josh+Long">Devoxx</a>, which I leave for on the 12th (in 24 hours, or so, basically).

 If you're in Belgium, this is <EM>the</EM> event to see! Come see me talk with Chris Richardson on Spring on Cloudfoundry for the university talk (3 hours! We're going to cover NoSQL, AMQP, the <CODE>&lt;cloud:/&gt;</CODE>  namespace, and much more!) and with Patrick Chanezon for a 1-hour introduction to getting started with Spring on CloudFoundry.    Additionally, I'll be participating in the Spring BOF. I've also got a
  Spring Roo "quickie" talk, and a talk on socializing your Spring applications using Spring Social.

  Should be utterly exhausting, but I look forward to seeing you all there! We're gonna have a lot of fun.
