Next week I'll also be  speaking at the [2018 edition of the _epic_ Devnexus show in Atlanta, GA](http://devnexus.com) talking about [testing applications](https://devnexus.com/presentations/1884/) (starting at individual beans in a Spring application and working [our way towards integration testing with microservices and consumer driven contract testing with Spring Cloud Contract) and then we'll look at building Kotlin-based applications [in _Bootiful Kotlin_](https://devnexus.com/presentations/1887/). Join me!
