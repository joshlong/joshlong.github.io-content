I finally broke down and did it: I just put in an order for the new  Keychron V10 (Alice Layout) QMK Custom Mechanical Keyboard as a little gift to myself for my upcoming birthday. 

I'm so looking forward to it. I've used either the Microsoft Natural keyboard or the Logitech ergo keyboards for decades, but they're both like little barges floating in the middle of my desk. Hopefully this will be more space/form-factor efficient and keep the carpal tunnel at bay. 

In the meantime, join me in enjoying the dulcent tones of Keychron keys.
