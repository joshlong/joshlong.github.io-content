 <a href="http://livelabs.com/seadragon-mobile/" target =
"_blank">SeaDragon</a>, an application from Microsoft that extracts
the "Deep Zoom" component from Silver Light and enables it on an
iPhone, has been released to the Apple Application Store (Wonders
never cease!) because the Apple iPhone has a fantastic GPU.

mobile component, but <a href="http://livelabs.com/seadragon-ajax/"

 This fuels the usual debate on Steve Jobs' health, as usual, and

       PLUS: My new favorite iPhone Application: <a
href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/16/taxi-magic-hail-a-cab-from-your-iphone-at-the-push-of-a-button/">Taxi
Magic</a>. Seriously -- how slick is that? When do you usually need a
Taxi? When you're most impaired, likely, say perhaps after drinking?
One button. Finally, technology for fun and profit.
