I just started playing with <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=296" target="_blank">JSR 296</a> as I've recently started building an application that's Swing based (albeit, as an applet, which I'd like to make Java Webstart-able). It's phenomenal! As it stands right now, you can easily databind, internationalize, easily layout GUIs, and build on a useful Action abstraction if you're willing (and able! And what rocket scientist isn't?? Oh, you're <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>a rocket scientist… well…. I see… Go sit in the corner.) to coordinate the tapestry of solutions out there. <br><br>JSR 296 seeks to bring a lot of that flexibility to the developer right off the bat. With it you get internationalization, an action model, application lifecycle, persistence, etc. Pretty cool. Still missing is databinding and IOC and a layout mechanism. Fortunately, <a href="http://spring-rich-c.sourceforge.net/index.html" target="_blank">SpringRich</a>, and <a href="https://jgoodies.dev.java.net/" target="_blank">JGoodies</a> help alleviate those pain points, so I'm pretty stoked about the possibilities. <br><br>Maybe one day we'll have a framework for the desktop user and it'll endeavor to bring "web-style programming" to the desktop.<br><br>Which reminds me: all those frameworks endeavoring to bring Swing-style programming to the web (Wicket, JSF, Tapestry, Echo, whatever else I missed: this means you!) should change their attitude a little. It's telling that all of the things this framework brings to the table have been de rigueur in web frameworks for half a decade.<br><br>Check out <a href="https://appframework.dev.java.net/intro/index.html" target="_blank">the Swing Application Framework</a> for more.<br><br>I wonder what this will mean for so much of the way an application is built currently. Will I have to become very good at securing SOAP services again? Will an easy, useful desktop programming paradigm reverse the transition from Web Services to JSON? I deployed a custom XML-based (not XML-RPC, or SOAP, but my own protocol) service specifically to be able to achieve modest portability/thoroughput on a prototype J2ME application I built a year or so ago. This was so because the XML parsers are sketchy enough. SOAP stacks (while available, even as a standard) weren't prevalent enough.&nbsp; I can see Spring earning it's keep here, again. Imagine what could be done with a useful databingn mechanism and a convenient way of exposing services (à la Spring). Desktop applications could become the rich client king again. Maybe. <br><br>Meanwhile Bruce Eckel <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=193593" target="_blank">seems to think rich clients are where it's at</a>, as well. Of course, he's pitching Flash, and not Swing. <br><br>Can't wait to see what's next. Windows Vista (Aero, WPF) is poised to make the rich client desktop commonplace. Maybe it'll heat up the landscape enough to drive a resurgence for the desktop developer.&nbsp; Any one use any of these tools? Anything I should know?
