I just posted another blog entry on Artima.com, called "Modeling to Avoid Hacking Your Model in ORM Mapping Format," and naturally would appreciate any feedback. The entry is available <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=247671">here.</a> The entry is a discussion on modeling, and its advantages, using either UML or ER. A solution using Maven is provided to provide a work flow using ER modeling.
