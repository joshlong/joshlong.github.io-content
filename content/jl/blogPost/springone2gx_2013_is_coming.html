Have you booked your tickets for <strong><a href="http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/santa_clara/2013/09/home">SpringOne2GX</a></strong>?  This year&#39;s show is a special one. In my work as the Spring Developer Advocate, I speak at <em>many</em> conferences all around the world. Ask any developer with a pulse, and they&#39;ll confirm that big data (and Hadoop), reactive web applications, REST, mobile application development, and cloud computing are sizzling hot topics today. Pivotal, and Spring, support today's developers, and SpringOne2GX's agenda represents in my estimation the perfect blend of content for today&#39;s developers. Check out <a href="https://springone2gx.com/conference/santa_clara/2013/09/springone/event_schedule">the agenda</a>. We&#39;ve just recently added talks on <a href="http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/santa_clara/2013/09/session?id=29165">big data</a>, and <a href="http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/santa_clara/2013/09/session?id=29425">REST service security with OAuth</a>. This will be our first show under <a href="http://gopivotal.com">Pivotal</a>, and it&#39;s the only place where you can talk to the developers working on the technologies you care about both at SpringSource and in the community. As you know, we&#39;ve just announced our Cloud Foundry conference, <a href="http://platformcf.com">Platform</a>, and SpringOne2GX full pass ticket holders may register for that show - which is at the same venue as SpringOne2GX just two days earlier - for free! If I had to pay for just one show a year, this would be that show.  Hurry the early bird rate expires this friday!</p>
