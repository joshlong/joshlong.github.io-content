Looking forward to presenting my talk on  <a href ="http://www.springio.net/agenda">Integration and Batch Processing with Cloud Foundry</A> tomorrow at Spring IO 2012.  
	
	RabbitMQ, Spring Integration and Cloud Foundry are Natural Vehicles for applications that handle large workloads and scale well. In this talk, I'll introduce common architectural patterns to  better scale, using Spring Integration and Spring Batch, using RabbitMQ as the communication fabric.  For those of you who want the deck, <a href = "http://www.slideshare.net/joshlong/enterprise-integration-and-batch-processing-on-cloud-foundry">it's available here</a>.
