Apple's got <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_self">Safari available for Windows</a> (is this a surprise to anyone though?). <br><br>The site wasn't as funny as when iTunes came out and the website had something to the effect of, "Hell's frozen over: iTunes for Windows." Good news, nonetheless!<br>
