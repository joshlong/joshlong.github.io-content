<P><img src = "/media/17860"  style = "float:left;padding-right:10px"  />Hi guys. I'll be speaking at <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/profile/108490">OSCON Java</a>. I'm giving two talks, one on Spring Roo and on using Spring to bring your application to your customers (through a web application, through Flex, through GWT, and through mobile clients like Android).  
 
I'm also working with my colleague and friend Steve Mayzak to write an ebook on  Spring Roo called "Getting Started with Spring Roo," which will be available from O'REILLY as an ebook in time for OSCON. 
  I hope to see you there. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jclouds/status/88755919684501504">I heard, but can't confirm</a>, that if you register tomorrow (07/07/2011 - the release of Java 7), you'll get a giant discount (77%?).  
 There are also a few other great talks from SpringSource and VMWare there, and I look forward to seeing you there! </p>
