<p> <img style = "float:left;" src = "/media/17859"/>Whew! Time sure flies! </p><p> I've been working 'round the clock of late with my fellow authors <a href="http://www.webforefront.com/">Daniel Rubio</a> and <a href="http://www.metaarchit.com">Gary Mak</a> to wrap up the writing for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spring-Recipes-Problem-Solution-Approach-Second/dp/1430224991">Spring Recipes, 2nd Edition</a> (more on that as it goes to press). This book's going to be second to none, folks.  Spring Roo, Grails, Spring Integration, Spring Batch, Flex, REST and many   (16, in fact!) other awesome chapters to bring you to the wide world of Spring 3. As a user of the Spring framework first and an author second, just trust me when I say I'd be very, very interested in buying this book if I wasn't already entitled to a free copy as an author. I digress. The book - all consuming though it is  -  isn't even why I'm writing this post! </p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/m_f_">Mark Fisher</a> - lead of the <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration">Spring Integration</a> project and all around nice guy (I'm going to throw in <i>brilliant</i>, as well, just in case you haven't had a chance to scour the code behind Spring Integration and come to that conclusion yourself) has been kind enough to let me contribute some adapters to the Spring Integration project  -  these adapters are centered around bridging communication between systems normally used by humans and automated systems. We have built support for <a href="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/INT-1106">XMPP</a> and <a href="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/INT-1199">Twitter</a> thus far. More's most assuredly coming, too! Looking into the crystal ball, I see ATOM and RSS playing a big part along with IRC. These adapters round out the support already provided for user-facing services like e-mail. </p><p>There's a lot of power and promise here. First, in a system with variable states, <a href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> is a very promising technology because - besides being a good way for diffent entities to exchange messages (it is, after all, the backing protocol behind Google Talk and Facebook chat) - it lets you add the notion of availability to actors in your system. Imagine a game, with users joining and leaving the game, or a chat room, or a grid of grid-nodes that may be taken off-line. XMPP provides a natural way of representing availability, which is increasingly important in a system with many fluctuating agents and states. </p><p>Twitter, ATOM/RSS and others are important because they let you consume human-synthesized events. Trends, volume, etc, are all interesting metrics that can be very valuable to your business.  I can see a lot of power in having a Twitter account that responds to queries or commands   - in much the same way as the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/033602/smarterchild-im-bot">Smarter Child IM</a> bot work(-s,-ed).  </p><p>In some sense, these adapters are only the beginning. They let your application  drink from the proverbial firehose of events, but what to do with them once you have them? Graph them? Send them to <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>? Send them through a <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-amqp">message broker</a>  (and, depending on the volume, <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">which one?</a>)?  Why not send them through a complex event processing (CEP) engine like <a href="http://esper.codehaus.org/">Esper</a> using this fantastic third party <a href="http://www.opencredo.com/technologies/opencredo-esper">Spring Integration adapter for Esper</a>? There, you can can process and analyze these events, and synthesize more interesting, complex events. </p><p>If this all sounds interesting to you (and why wouldn't it?), you should check out <a href="http://www.oscon.com">OSCON</a> next week in Portland, OR. I'll be there giving a talk called the "<a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/13391">The Social Enterprise Service Bus.</a>" I'll be with some colleagues and friends from <a href="http://tech.shopzilla.com/">Shopzilla,</a>  too. If you'd like to grab a beer, ping me on Twitter (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/starbuxman">@starbuxman</a>) and we'll see what we can do! This is my first time presenting at OSCON, so I'm looking forward to attending some of the other talks almost as much as I am about getting a chance to talk to you guys. Hope to see you there!</p>
