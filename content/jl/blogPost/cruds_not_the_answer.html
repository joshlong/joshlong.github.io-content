<p> I was really glad to see  <a 
href="http://www.udidahan.com/2009/09/01/dont-delete-just-dont/">Udi 
Dahan's, "Don't Delete. Just Don't."</a> I wholely agree with the main 
premise - that deletion is rarely, if ever, a valid business state and 
that care should be taken in dealing with it. He cites various 
examples, saying, "The real world doesn't cascade." His example is of 
a marketing department that deletes an item from the catalog. Should 
all orders containing that item then be unlinked? Should they redo the 
company's profit and loss statments? </p> <p> His example's a  perfect 
illustration of a valid case where care needs to be taken both in 
modeling the case and dealing with it in code. I fear a lot of people 
have gotten hooked on instant-models or CRUD "frameworks." The idea 
that you can annotate a few entity classes and suddenly you have a 
model and business logic all taken care. A lot of this became popular 
with Ruby on Rails and has only gotten worse in the JEE world. It's 
now common to expose <code>EntityManager</code>s to the web tier (both 
the Seam and Spring Web Flow examples, not to mentino the Open Session 
in View pattern itself, speak to this) and to let web frameworks 
handle the lifecycle of entities and  committing transactions on that 
EntityManager to persist those entities. We now think of record 
creation and managment as so mundane that we've automated it and 
surrounded it in scaffolding. </p> <p> Unfortuntately, this misses the 
true value. Objects in a system have state that has dependencies. Just 
because an entity has a (required) no-args constructor, it doesn't 
mean that you should not write a constructor with dependencies. A lot 
of this stems from the "active objects" or "naked objects" pattern, 
where objects are open books whose state can be mutated on the UI tier 
directly and those changes propagated directly. We tell ourselves that 
we can apply Hibernate validations (or validations in any other ORM 
framework) and that we'll guarantee valid business constraints thus, 
but it rarely works out that way. Prescribing the valid creation and 
destruction of an object is critical. </p> <p> The most insidious part 
of this abuse is that it  rarely ever occurs in the first iterations 
of a project, only in maintenance.  People "forget" how an object is 
created, or destroyed. They forget details. Consistancy with other 
parts of the system is forsaken because, after all, how much could 
there be to it? This happens more often than you'd expect: new people 
come on to the team and are assigned to rework an existing feature and 
screen in a system. Institutional knowledge is important but it's not 
always easily transferred, so safe-guards need to be taken. </p> <p> 
Plus, as business evolves, object creation is often only part and 
parcel with a larger process. If a new customer is added to a 
database, and nobody does anything with it, did it really get added? 
Put another way: if a new customer gets added to a database, there's 
an implied lifecycle that customer must follow. Perhaps a trial period 
window and then a follow up email? Perhaps a monthly subscriptio fee? 
Who knows, but the act of instantiating a <code>Customer</code> object 
and then issuing <code>entityManager.persist( customer ) </code> will 
rarely, if ever, be enough. </p> <p> Indeed, I've seen  many projects 
build their models using only a <code>GenericDao&lt;T&gt;</code> 
variant.  This is dangerous.  Transitions from one state to another 
for an entity can often cost money.  </p> <p>Do things the old 
fashioned way, building services that handle the business operations, 
not merely <b>C</b>reate, <b>R</b>ead,<b>U</b>pdate and <b>D</b>elete 
objects.  Using Dao's in a view tier is almost as ghastly a sin as 
making JDBC calls from the view, and encourages the same kind of 
copy-n-paste code reuse we prided ourselves on having moved away from. 
</p> <p> While the services approach isn't exactly code-generation 
friendly, it can pay off in the long run. As soon as you decide to use 
your services in a phsically separated tier, you'll be glad.  It's 
easier to build services that express every dependency as a method 
parameter. There are several reasons why this works out. While web 
service support is getting better, object marshalling is still the 
number one headache. Most toolkits make interoping with primitives a 
brease, though. It may seem like your losing ground by not taking 
advantage of the POJO you have floating around in the view tier, but 
in point of fact it's rarely that big a burden to unmarshal the 
relevant fields and use those instead. On the services side, reloading 
the relevant record is painless because the entity's usually cached 
and thus refetching it is cheap. </p> <p> Take for example the idea of 
a shopping cart which surfaces methods for adding line items to 
orders, orders to shopping carts and shopping carts to customers.  A 
clean version of this might look like: <pre><code> 
 public interface ShoppingCartService { 
     ShoppingCart createShoppingCartForCustomer( long customerId, 
                                                 Date 
whenShoppingSessionStarted ) ; 
     Order createOrderForShoppingCart( long shoppingCart ) ; 
     LineItem createLineItemForOrder( long orderId, long productId, 
int quantity) ; 
     void removeLineItemFromOrder( long orderId, long lineItem ) ; 
     void startOrderFulfillment( long orderId ) ; 
     /*  other methods for loading and removing the various 
         objects, as appropriate 
     */ 
  } 
</code></pre> </p> <p> In these methods, you can do sanity checks, 
care for business cases, handle the state of the various objects and 
not worry about having a transactional resource like an <code> 
EntityManager</code> or Hibernate Session open in the client thread. 
In this example, you might imagine the <code> Order</code> won't 
officially be fulfilled until it's paid for, at which point it'll move 
to the <code>PAID</code> state.  Simialarly, adding a 
<code>LineItem</code> might require a check to an inventory, 
decrementing how many of those <code>Product</code>s are in stock. The 
same is true of the inverse operation: 
<code>removeLineItemFromOrder</code> should appropriately restore the 
inventory count and update the <code>totalPrice</code> field on the 
<code>Order</code>.</p> This requires one interface method 
declaration's work more than if you had simply obtained the 
<code>EntityManager</code> from your Seam backing bean and executed 
the logic there, <i>except</i> now the logic's codified and reusable.
