<p> 
  Often times, a message queue is used as a way to publish "events" to 
other services in the enterprise. The publish/subscribe architecture 
decouples clients from the senders and alleviates the publisher from 
specific knowledge of the consumers of the messages. This, plus the 
asynchronous nature of a message queue 
 - the publisher does not block while clients consume the events - 
makes it ideal for publishing events to keep other systems aware of 
the state of a given system. 
</p><p> 
 Now, let's establish the use case: we want to consume events in a 
very busy system. In our case, it's possible to receive multiple 
events. Or, perhaps in your system you've positioned the message queue 
as a way to deliver commands - "pings" - using the "command bus" 
pattern. It may - and quite often is - be acceptable to ignore 
duplicate requests in architectures like these. 
 For example, a "command" message notifying a system that it can being 
processing a batch of data for the day only needs to be handled once 
per day, not 10 times, even if 10 different events are published. It'd 
be ghastly and inefficient to process the load 10x a day. What's 
required is some way to make message submission <em>idempotent</em> 
for certain messages - to make them indifferent to duplicate message 
submission. 
</p>  <p>  Backstory: I've been playing with JBoss' <a 
href="http://jboss.org/hornetq/">HornetQ</a> a lot recently. It's a 
<em>very</em> fast message queue: it recently bested ActiveMQ in the 
<a href="http://www.timfox.me/2010/02/jboss-hornetq-sets-record-specjms2007.html">SpecJMS2007 
benchmark by more than 300%!</a>. It is able to perform these feats 
because it uses a native, asynchronous IO layer on Linux centered 
around the kernel's <code>libaio</code> functionality. 
 On all other platforms, it's just gosh darned fast, regardless, but 
doesn't benefit from the native code acceleration. 
</p> <p>   So, imagine my surprise when I found out that HornetQ 
supports something it calls a Last-Value Header - a well known message 
header that - when the value is duplicated by other messages - causes 
the submitted message to override the existing message: the latest 
message with a duplicate header wins. 
</p><p> Here's how code submission to the queue looks using Spring's 
<a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/jms.html#jmstemplate">JmsTemplate</a> 
functionality: </p> 
<PRE> <CODE> 
this.jmsTemplate.send(this.destination, new MessageCreator() { 
    public Message createMessage(final Session session) throws JMSException { 
        TextMessage textMessage = session.createTextMessage( ... ); 
       <b> textMessage.setStringProperty("_HQ_LVQ_NAME", 
someUniqueStringThatYouSpecify); </b> 
        return textMessage; 
    } 
}); 
</CODE></PRE> 
<p> So, it's often easy to find a business value that can be used to 
derive a semantically correct, unique key to identify duplicate 
events. Processing a customer's order with 3 items in the shopping 
cart at 12:30:30s PM? Build a key combining the 30 second window, the 
customer ID, the count of items, and the order ID. This provides a 
service-level mechanism to prevent nasty double submit issues, for 
example. 
<p> You need to enable this characteristic on the queue itself in the 
configuration files. 
<p> 
 In HornetQ there are a few files under the 
<CODE>$HORNETQ/config/</code> folder that you need to be aware of to 
configure HornetQ: <code>hornrtq-jms.xml</code>, 
<code>hornetq-configuration.xml</code>, and 
<code>hornetq-users.xml</code>. In this scenario, we need to only 
modify the <code>hornetq-configuration.xml</code>. 
</p> 
<p> For a queue configured in <code>hornetq-jms.xml</code as follows: </p> 
<PRE><CODE> 
   &lt;queue name="dupesQueue"&gt; 
        &lt;entry name="<b>/queue/dupesQueue</b>"/&gt; 
        &lt;durable&gt;true&lt;/durable&gt; 
    &lt;/queue&gt; 
</pre></CODE> 
<p> ... you'll need to make the following changes to 
<code>hornetq-configuration.xml</code>:</p> 
<code><pre> 
  &lt;address-setting match="<b>jms.queue.dupesQueue</b>"&gt; 
         <span style ="text-decoration:underline"> 
&lt;last-value-queue&gt;true&lt;/last-value-queue&gt;</span> 
        &lt;/address-setting&gt; 
</pre></code> 
 <p>Simple, right? So, go ahead, send all the messages you want - only 
one will remain (unless of course that message is consumed. This only 
guards against duplicate submissions assuming the messages haven't 
been delivered yet. Enjoy!</p>
