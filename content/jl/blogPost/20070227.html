I love working with Tapestry 4, but I figure that it's because it's already configured to do the cool tricks I want to do with it. It's not easy getting off the ground on a blank new project. (Nor is it easy getting off the ground in a Ruby On Rails project without using the project generator!). Maven offers a solution, but, seemingly, no good archetype for it exists. I want something that'll let me type mvn jetty6:run and pull up a page immediately after I've run the familiar "mvn archetype:create" incantation.<br><br>I tried the (admittedly preliminary, at this stage in the game) Appfuse archetype,&nbsp; and the one from Webtide. However, I wanted something that I could demo with really quickly. I imagine: 1.) I have the archetype. 2.) I mvn clean install it, and voil√†, instant "hello world" application that could be aggressively/quickly modified. I took Howard Lewis Ship's Tapestry 5 Simple-Project archetype and expanded it/retrofitted it with a lot of Tapestry 4 scenarios. <br><br>I also wanted something that eased some real-world concerns or, at least, hid them. Something that already had a working example of most common things (setting up an ASO, using Spring. Perhaps I'll add SEO friendly URLs configured by default (well, for the common ones, with the less-obvious options commented and explained.). <br><br>Anyway, thanks again to Howard and the Tapestry for such a wonderful product. I'll evolve this version and clean it up. If there are any suggestions, I'd definitely appreciate it. <br><br>It's deployed to my repostory. Run the following command, and you'll have the archetype installed and a project created. Then, merely cd into the wordking directory and run <code>mvn idea:idea</code>, or <code>mvn eclipse:eclipse</code>, and then run <code>mvn jetty6:run</code> to get started. This will get your application running on port 8080. Simply bring up http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and you'll get a listing of all the contexts. You can modify the various configuration fles (save, of course, for web.xml), and HTML ad-infinitum without restarting. The second you compile a fresh class, Jetty will reload the context automatically. <br><br><code>mvn archetype:create -DarchetypeGroupId=com.codecafe.archetypes
