<p>I stumbled upon the samples site from <a href="http://phpgwt.com">phpgwt.com</a> â€“ which features this <a href="http://samples.gwtphp.com/pax4/merchants/index.php">application.</a> The application seems to perform and work reasonably well in all browsers, although the transparent .pngs that are prevalent on the site don't seem to work well in Internet Explorer 6. Naturally, your mileage my vary, but I tested it against Firefox 3.0, Chrome, and Internet Explorer. Gorgeous. Similarly, look at the sample applications coming from <a href="http://extjs.com/products/gxt">ExtJS </a>OR <a href="http://www.gwt-ext.com/demo">GWT-EXT</a>. The first one's not quite as impressive as the second one, however, the second one may be at a dead end due to a licensing spat (<a href="http://www.gwtsite.com/ext-gwt-gwt-ext-what-now/">as detailed here</a>). </p><p>I should have a tutorial detailing how to get started with some of these technologies pretty soon.</p>
