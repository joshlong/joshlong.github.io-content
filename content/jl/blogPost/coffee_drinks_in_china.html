<P> 
 My amazing adventure in Shanghai, China is almost up. I return home to the US on January 31, and must  wind down my time here. As part of that, I need to finish my <EM>amazing</EM> stash 
'o iced coffee drinks that I've only found here in China. I don't know if you know this about me, but I <EM>love</EM> coffee. 
 And yes, before you ask, that really is the bedspread they gave me at this hotel in Shanghai. @_@
