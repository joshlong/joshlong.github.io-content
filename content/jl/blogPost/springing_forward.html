<P>I can't believe how quickly things have come and gone. I thought
2009 was great, but 2010 year no doubt takes the cake! Now that we're
all on the other side of the new year, I thought I'd take a quick
look at my year (and my decade) and talk about the Spring framework.</P>
<P>Last decade started strangely for a lot of us here in the United
States. We saw a very strange election, the source of much discord in
the political world. Scandalous though that might have seemed, it
would all seem so fleeting when two planes crashed into the twin
towers in New York City, New York. The reactions of a panicked
country seemingly under siege would change the landscape over the
next several years. The ramifications are still very pronounced and
felt, I fear, in every corner of this tiny little planet.</P>
<P>I started the decade, and my professional career, wading through
the dot-com boom and subsequent bust. I've been fortunate to have
worked with a lot of startups over the years. I've also worked in
stodgy, established corporations.  I feel like working at a bank is
the easiest way to fall through the cracks in life. It never ceases
to amaze me that there are projects in some banks being started this
very day, January 1, 2011 (1/1/11..!) using Struts 1. 
</P>
<P>It has been my experience that startups have the blessing - and
burden - of having no room for failure. I have spent a lot of time
making things work that just shouldn't work. While I've always been
best-practices-oriented, I was leery of any gospel according to the
vendors. I once had a manager utterly terrorize me because I was
using EJBs when he had PHP script kiddies that purported to be able
to deliver a huge function of the project done by "just downloading
a script!" This taught me a valuable lesson. Looking back, I
suspect the manager's claim was probably genuine, and I feel like
such a heel for blindly relying on the vendors' claims that EJBs were
the way forward, the future. I never could convince myself that the
PHP way was <I>the </I> way, but
there was no denying the obvious productivity gains for many common
tasks.  There was a time when I was looking pretty seriously at
moving to .NET because it promised radically improved turnaround
times. One of my main reservations about the then-nascent .NET
ecosystem was the lack of open-source. I've always worked hard to use
open-source if I could. 
</P>
<P>The Spring framework came along just in time. Engineers that
survive in startups tend to be scrappy engineers who are interested
in results, not process, and who aren't in it for the 9-5 shift, but
for results. The Spring framework is open source; it closed the gap
between .NET and Java by providing niceties like declarative
remoting, declarative transactions, etc; it also helps further
best-practices, not hinder them. I've been a true believer in the
Spring framework from day one.  
</P>
<P>In early 2005, I moved to Tempe, Arizona to help start a company.
The venture was a victim of the wayward economy when the housing bust
hit. While I made some great friends, I was
glad to return to Los Angeles in March of 2009.

Early in 2010 I had the fantastic good fortune to join a company
here in Los Angeles called <A HREF="http://www.shopzilla.com">Shopzilla</A>
- they're the group behind <A HREF="http://www.bizrate.com/">BizRate.com</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.beso.com/">BeSo.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.shopzilla.com/">Shopzilla.com</A>,
and <A HREF="http://tada.com/">tada.com</A>, each of which gets a
staggering amount of traffic. They use the Spring framework
extensively and feature an excellent engineering environment as well
as one of the best workplace environments in the business (arcade,
lounge, free lunch, great perks, gym, etc., etc.). There are many
brilliant people at Shopzilla. I think it is our natural tendency to
approach strange codebases with trepidation and a sense of, "well,
I could do this better!" and a lot of times, unfortunately, that
instinct is on the money. I never felt that way with the large swaths
of code I encountered in Shopzilla's codebase. 
</P>
<P>I've been in the unfortunate position in my life of having to work
at places where engineers were begrudged unit tests; where code and
projects were wildly inconsistent, or antiquated across projects;
where there was a strong, undue sense of code ownership and code was
walled off to all but two engineers (who had twelve weeks off yearly
and were busy planning their retirements). Shopzilla was the
antithesis. It was... wonderful to be completely unencumbered by
management and bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>I loved Shopzilla's earnest maximization of the Spring framework. </P>
<P>Let me try to explain. If you'll permit a generalization,
engineers at startups can't afford to trust, anything. No time, after
all. You hope that people already appreciate the benefits of code
reuse, of course. I wonder if those people also realize the
responsibility that comes with reuse. If something breaks in that
code, its up to you to see it gets fixed. Keeping a stack as
open-source centric as possible facilitates fixes. Broken code in a
server is bad, but try <I>proving </I>it, let alone fixing it,
without the source code! Support contracts might help there, but
rarely as quickly as you need it to. It takes courage to use other
people's code, and it takes courage to trust <I>and</I>
verify promises extended by that code. It takes skill to integrate -
and to care - about the big picture system, and not just the
individual moving parts, too.  
</P>
<P> That is my conceptual framework
when approaching projects. I use the Spring framework because it
integrates with many different technologies and insulates users from
the idiosyncrasies between various technologies through a unified
component model. It levels the playing field. Depending on the stack,
there are any number of places one might have to tailor a project 's
behavior to the requirements of a system. Logging frameworks, service
tiers, web service tiers, caching frameworks, web (including core
APIs like Servlets), workflow engines, integration engines,
processing grids, batch processing frameworks, job scheduling
frameworks, etc., all have their own notion of a "component" in
that domain, and each one of them expects you to work in terms of
that component model, ignoring the uniformity and conventions you'd
hoped to establish across your code base. 
</P>
<P> Spring opens the doors to all
these technologies (and untold many others) and lets you work in
terms of <I>your </I> domain
model. The engineers behind the Spring framework have plumbed the
depths of these various frameworks and done the legwork to make it
easy for you to integrate them in a manner consistent with your
codebase. Where they've had to, they've fixed parts of these
projects, and provided less risky paths for integration. Often, this
process is as simple as dismantling the custom component model in
place and letting people think in terms of plain 'ol Java objects
(POJOs), avoiding the inconsistent, ever-varying, project-specific
configuration files.  
</P>
<P>Spring's power - and the reason why I personally find the very
notion of some other pure play IoC container like CDI as a "competitor"
to Spring to be laughable at best - is its rich, unified libraries
and the platform that it provides through its integrations. Spring
provides a clean, consistent metaphor for approaching problems. It
provides libraries that are idiomatic and that work wonderfully
together, and it provides services that can be weaved in a clean way
across an application. These libraries are often layered. They
present the 90% case solution first, but provide hooks through the
use of things like strategy interfaces and callback methods should
you need to tailor the behavior. 
</P>
<P>The Spring framework is a very good example of the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle">open/closed
principle</A>. It is telling that very few people even know about all
of the Spring framework's extension points; most people don't need
them. For 90% of the use cases, Spring makes the impossible easy, and
provides the flexibility to tackle the other 10%. Where possible,
Spring makes facets of an application invisible -  things that used
to require an API. Where there is still an API dependency, Spring
typically ships with a cleaner API that insulates you from it or
simplifies it. 
</P>
<P>I mention all of this because Shopzilla's architecture and
applications - as much as possible - lived in the 90%; things were as
simple as possible thanks to Spring and the <I>incredible </I>diligence
of the engineering team. Shopzilla really excelled in all the little
10% spots, too. They used or extended everything, taking nothing for
granted. Shopzilla had a custom Spring MVC view resolver and view
templating format, for example. They have a custom JMS message
listener container that was geared to batching in the style of the
Spring framework's message listener container. They made ingenious
use of monitoring, Spring's amazing AOP support, JMX, and various
open source projects to handle terabytes of logging. The entire
federated architecture across several different teams used REST and a
standard, Maven controlled archetype to keep projects standardized.
In essence, as part of a engineering-wide culture of consistency, and
code reuse, Shopzilla had built upon and extended the Spring
framework, and it underpinned everything they did. Shopzilla
integrated technologies and published reusable solutions for common
problems so that <I>everybody</I> 
benefited in the same way that the Spring framework itself does.</P>
<P>Shopzilla's amazing, and I would recommend it to anybody if you're
looking for an amazing company to work for.</P>

So, when I was approached to join SpringSource as the Spring
developer advocate, I was at once sad to leave Shopzilla, but elated
at the prospect of playing a part in this technology that had so well
served me for the better part of the last 8 years. Leaving Shopzilla
was painful, of course, but I had to see this opportunity through. I
have a deep respect for SpringSource and the committed engineers
there who  - even as I write this, on the last Saturday on New
Year's weekend - are sending emails about developments in the
projects! I've been with SpringSource since August. SpringSource is a
worldwide organization, so no matter what time of day it is, there is
somebody committing something awesome, somewhere, in plain view of
the world. If I'm not careful, I forget to leave my desk trying to
keep up with all the exciting stuff! 
</P>
<P>Spring's made my decade much more pleasant than it might've
otherwise been. If you'd told me we'd have something like the Spring
framework in 2000, and that I'd be privileged enough to work with the
people behind it, I would have dropped my CORBA and EJB books on your
feet. It would have seemed so cruel to joke about something like
that. 
</P>
<P>It's been a fantastic decade, and a particularly fantastic 2010,
and I can't wait to see what comes next. 
</P>
<P>I hope you had a safe, joyous New Years, and I wish you a
fantastic new year, and a new decade.
