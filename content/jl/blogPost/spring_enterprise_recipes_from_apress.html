<br/> I am pleased to announce that, after a long time and a lot of 
work, my first book <b><i>Spring Enterprise Recipes</i></b> (which I 
co-authored with the indefatigable, epic and extraordinary Mr. Gary 
Mak, author of - among many other things, Apress' <i>Spring 
Recipes</i>) has been released and is now purchasable.  It should be 
hitting book stores soon, but in the meantime, you can <a 
href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/9781430224976">buy  the e-book 
at Apress.com</a>, or you can pre-order it <a 
href="http://www.amazon.com/Spring-Enterprise-Recipes-Problem-Solution-Approach/dp/1430224975">on 
Amazon.com</a>. </p><p> The book discusses Spring 3, but also accounts 
for the many "modules" surrounding Spring with an eye towards building 
elegant, scalable systems with a minimum of fuss.  Many of these 
modules have come from SpringSource, and some are independent third 
party projects that integrate well with Spring.  <i>Spring Enterprise 
Recipes</i> introduces concepts like business process management 
(BPM), enterprise application integration (EAI), distributed computing 
and messaging and then grounds these introductions with real-world 
examples using Spring and lead open source frameworks. 
 </p> 
<p>This book discusses both the <i>why</i> and the <i>how</i>. It 
starts with  a discussion of the usual suspects, exploring the 
quintessential tools in any developer's toolbox: RPC (RMI, Hessian, 
Burlap, Web Services, HTTP/Invoker, EJB 2 and 3, and more), messaging 
(via JMS), database access (JdbcTemplate, and a few of Spring's 
numerous supported ORM abstractions), transactions (e.g., various 
transaction abstractions supported by Spring), and numerous services 
like e-mail, JMX, worker pools, and  scheduling infrastructure.</p> 
<p>Then, we progress into more advanced solutions. This book includes 
the first-in-print or most updated coverage of a lot of technologies, 
including Spring Integration (a lightweight ESB-like integration 
framework for EAI),   Spring and jBPM 4 for business process 
management, GridGain for grid computing,  Terracotta for clustered 
state managment, Spring Batch for batch-processing solutions and OSGi 
to bring modularity to your application. 
</p> 
 <p> In the large, this book is a gentle, but comprehensive 
introduction to the best-of-breed solutions for tomorrow's 
architecture using Spring and other lightweight, powerful tools. 
Having said all that, I hope you'll consider it for your next purchase 
and that it helps you solve some interesting problems and build even 
more interesting solutions!
