<p>The major leap forward seems to be project lifecycle management, and collaboration suites. It doesn't seem like too long ago that we had a compiler, an editor, and some sticky notes. </p><p>In the Microsoft camp, my lowly Visual C++ has evolved into <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx">Visual Studio Team System/Team Foundation System/Orca/super maximized enterprise grid suite 2.0/whatever</a>, which in turn is an editor on top of the compiler, a collaboration suite with groupware-features and a source versioning system&nbsp; (and maybe that's an undersell?)!</p><p>And Borland, oh-don't-get-me-started! Borland's <a href="http://www.borland.com/us/products/index.html">whole business</a> is now centered on everything that happens before and after the work in JBuilder has been done: it's all about the lifecycle of the project. </p><p>JetBrains has their <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity product</a>, which - along with their TMate source control client - form a suite of collaboration tools above and beyond working in IntelliJ. Even IntelliJ now has the ability to "share" a coding session with someone. &nbsp;</p><p>And, now, I just read about the Eclipse Foundation's (and tech-lead Erich Gamma's) push into collab-suites with Eclipse Jazz (eh, <a href="http://redmonk.com/cote/2006/06/07/rational-jazz-soon-to-eat-more-of-its-own-dog-food-transparency/">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/tt/talks/videos/ErichGammaText/interview.tss">here</a>). Of course, (the former) Rational has always been about this sort of thing in a lot of ways, so it's no surprise the influence eventually found its way to Eclipse. Interesting, I say! &nbsp;</p><p>Does this mean there's little more vendors can see doing for individual developers? <a href="http://www.intellij.com">IntelliJ&nbsp; IDEA</a>) (mmm.. I love you) is good, but is it really the be-all-end-all of individual productivity? All without one patronizing Wizard? Really? Also, I'm a little unclear on how this new wave of software fits in with traditional tools. </p><p>Suppose I have a wiki and bug defect system (<a href="http://trac.edgewall.org">Trac</a>)), a source control system (<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>), an IDE (IntelliJ, emacs) and an email address/IM client, a project management tool (Microsoft Project?), and even a build system with a deficiency complex (<a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> and <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/">Bamboo</a>) what am I missing?</p>
