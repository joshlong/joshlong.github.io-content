<p> Hello, world! I've been utterly and completely drowned in 
lake-busy these last few months. Updates may be a little slow for the 
next month, too. I've started working as an editor for <a 
href="http://www.infoq.com/author/Josh-Long">Infoq.com's Java 
Queue</a>. Work is progressing apace on my next Spring book, and some 
exciting things are happening in my personal life pretty soon. Plus, 
I'm working on an opensource side-project that'll unveil hopefully 
pretty soon here.  Anyway, check out my updates on Infoq.com if you 
want good old fashioned news, and on Twitter if you want commentary in 
140 character chunks.   Sorry I can't say more, but I will when I can! 
If you're going to <a href="http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/">The 
Server SIde Java Symposium</a> next month (March 17-19), don't forget 
to say hi, and <a 
href="http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/html/speakers.html#JLong">attend 
my sessions!</a>
