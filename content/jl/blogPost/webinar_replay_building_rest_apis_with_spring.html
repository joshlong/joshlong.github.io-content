The video of my webinar on
<a href= "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC0FPuDKei0"> building RESTful APIs with Spring is available online</a>. The webinar is basically a whirwind tour of Spring MVC, Spring HATEOAS (for Hypermedia), Spring Data REST (for conventions-oriented REST endpoints powered by Spring Data repositories), Spring Security and Spring Security OAuth to lock down the API, and Spring Social to consume the OAuth API in a clean, consistant manner from Java and Android.
