<P>   I'm in India (Bangalore and Hyderabad) and the news today is of the passing  of   Ravi Shankar, the <em>sitar virtuoso</EM> who's music influenced the <EM>Beatles</EM> in the 60s and changed the genre in some ways. 
 The first introduction to him that I had was  through the music of his daughters on   <EM><A href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_for_George">Concert for George</A></EM> (Harrison), a tribute concert to honor the late Beatle. From there, I explored his other music and in particular his influence on the <EM>Beatles</EM> and really have a lot of respect for the man.  

He was an amazingly talented musician, and all walks of music owe him a debt of gratitude. RIP <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shankar">Ravi Shankar</a>.
