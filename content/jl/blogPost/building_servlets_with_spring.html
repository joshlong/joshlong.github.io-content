<h2>The Problem</h2> <p> <a 
href="http://www.joshlong.com/jl/blogPost/quick_update_to_rss.html">Earlier</a>, 
I wrote about having to build a solution using servlets to write out 
the contents of the RSS feed for my blog. I am using JSF on this site. 
There are solutions - like Pretty Faces - that work and provide a 
lot of flexibility for mouting JSF logic at a given URL. So, 
initially, my RSS and Atom feeds were being handled by a backing bean 
in JSF. Being JSF, this necessitated the need for a session cookie 
(even though, clearly, the RSS / Atom feeds are stateless.) </p> <p> 
The cookie wouldn't have been so bad, except that - I think as a 
consequence - RSS readers consuming the blog were being constantly 
refreshed for the entire contents of the feed, because to them the 
resultant blog requested was "different" than the previous version. 
</p> <h2>The Solution </h2> <p>So, I planned to write a servlet that 
handled the requests and I expose that in my JSF application.  This 
would be a clear differentiator between the new Spring + JSF version 
of the software running my blog and the old Spring MVC version: it's 
uselessly difficult to support stateless endpoints with JSF, where as 
it's as natural a goal as anything in Spring MVC. </p><p> Using a 
servlet meant I'd lose two advantages I'd had in the JSF application 
with Pretty Faces: bookmarkable URLs, and the convenient programming 
environment that Spring Faces afforded me, namely, configuration, 
dependency injection, etc. </p> <h2>Refinements</h2> <p> I decided to 
use <a href="http://tuckey.org/urlrewrite/">URLRewrite</a> to solve 
the boomkarkable URLs (yes, that means this site is hosting not one, 
but <i>two</i> solutions for bookmarkable URLs in the same 
<code>.war</code>!) and Spring's under appreciated 
<code>HttpRequestHandler</code>. </p> <p> 
<code>HttpRequestHandler</code> is an interface that, when 
implemented, becomes serviceable by a Spring framework servlet. The 
interface looks like: 
<pre><code> 
package org.springframework.web; 
<br/> 
public interface HttpRequestHandler {<br/> 
   void handleRequest(HttpServletRequest request, 
HttpServletResponse response)            throws 
ServletException, IOException;<br/> 
} 
</code></pre></p><p>You then configure a Spring framework class 
(<code>org.springframework.web.context.support.HttpRequestHandlerServlet</code>) 
in your web.xml and name the servlet  the same as the bean that 
implements the <code>HttpRequestHandler</code> interface is named in 
your Spring application context. By virtue of the fact that your 
<code>HttpRequestHandler</code> bean is a Spring component, you get 
all the advantages of using Spring or Spring MVC, without having to 
load an entire framework. 
</p><p> For my code, the implementation looks something like the following:

               showAllRssBlogs(request, response);

           loggingUtils.log(ExceptionUtils.getFullStackTrace(th)); 
       } 
   } 
} 
</CODE></PRE> 
</p> 
<p> Thus, it's simpler than a standard Spring MVC controller or a 
struts controller (though admittedly lacking a lot of the frills - 
this happens to be a simple use case.</p> <p> I then configured the 
web.xml for all of this: <code><pre> 
   &lt;servlet&gt; 
       &lt;servlet-name&gt;feed&lt;/servlet-name&gt; 
       <b>&lt;servlet-class&gt;org.springframework.web.context.support.HttpRequestHandlerServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;</b> 
   &lt;/servlet&gt;<br/> 
   &lt;servlet-mapping&gt; 
       &lt;servlet-name&gt;feed&lt;/servlet-name&gt; 
       &lt;url-pattern&gt;/urlPatternForFeedServlet&lt;/url-pattern&gt; 
   &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt; 
</pre></code> 
</p> 
<p>Note that we've used the name fo the bean (configured using bean 
classpath scanning, so the name is in the <code>@Component</code> 
stereotype at the top of the class - <code>"feed"</code>.) for the 
servlet name. Sure, it smells a bit like engineered coincadence, but 
it works well. </p> <p>From here, all that remained was configuring a 
URLRewrite rule to map the servlet to the endpoints visible on the 
site right now (<code>"/jl/entries/blog.atom"</code>, and 
<code>"/jl/entries/blog.rss"</code>)</p><p> Hope this helps 
somebody... </p>
