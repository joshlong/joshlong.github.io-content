<p>I've moved to San Francisco, CA!  Found a nice place in Nob Hill for the king's ransom of 300% of what I was paying in Pasadena, CA, just a few weeks earlier. 
   Anyway... I only mention this because... I'm in town. Let's grab a drink and talk <A href ="http://www.springsource.org">Spring</A> and <A href="http://cloudfoundry.org">Cloud Foundry</A>. JUGs? Meetups? Hackathons? Let's do <EM>all</EM> the meetups.   Plus, this has  the additional benefit of putting me  in town for more of the awesome events / meetings with my SpringSource colleagues! 
 Life is <EM>so</EM> good sometimes.
