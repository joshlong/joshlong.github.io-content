<p><a href="http://www.springsource.org/about">Spring 3.0's out (you 
didn't get the memo?),</a> and there's a <i>lot</i> of interesting 
stuff. 
This release has been long in coming due in no small part to the 
specifications it tracks and to the intense furvor and emphasis placed 
on quality assurance and testing. One target platform - JEE6 (and with 
it the final versions of JSR330) - also just recently went final, and 
you'll find support for these technologies, as well, where 
appropriate. 
Now that it's out, you can start certifying applications in production 
on it. I've found that - aside from dealing with the new Maven 
imports - the upgrade process has been flawless. I've taken complex 
applications and merely fixed the jars and they continue to work. You 
will find, however, that there are a lot of reasons to go through and 
start selectively enabling new features, and namespaces. 
</p><p> In our book <a href= 
"http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430224975">Spring Enterprise 
Recipes</a>, my co-author Gary Mak and I discuss a lot of the new, 
exciting Spring 3.0 features. Spring 3.0 debuts slightly more 
streamlined scheduling / TaskExecutor / thread pool support. The idea 
is that you can more readily model asynchronous, repeating (at a 
scheduled time, rate, or both), and concurrent programming problems 
using these facilities and - in some cases - do so while leveraging 
more advanced facilities underlying a given target platform, like the 
WorkerJ implementations, the Java5 task executors, and thread pools 
and more. </p> 
<p> I won't go into much of that here as the book ablely covers most 
of it, but one thing I did want to cover (which we couldn't cover in 
time in the book as the feature was not ready as the book went to 
press) was the very elegant <code>task</code> namespace. 
<h2>Background </h2><p> It should be noted that these features are 
not, exactly, novel. Spring has shipped with a Quartz scheduling 
framework integration for years. Among many other niceties included 
therein was (and still is, for what it's worth) a <a 
href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/1.2.x/reference/scheduling.html">MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean</a> 
that allowed you to schedule future executions of a method on a Java 
bean using Quartz. </P><P> A few years later, EJB 3 debuted support 
for a limited form of scheduling using the <code>Timer</code> 
mechanism. One major limitation was the lack of support for CRON-like 
expressions and for asynchronous methods. Naturally, you could use JMS 
to acheive the same effect, in a way...</P><P>The JBoss gang debuted 
JBoss Seam support for <a 
href="http://docs.jboss.org/seam/2.2.0.GA/reference/en-US/html_single/#d0e21502">scheduled 
and asynchronous method execution on a Seam component</a> as well as a 
proprietary mechanism to <a 
href="http://www.jboss.org/file-access/default/members/jbossejb3/freezone/docs/tutorial/1.0.7/html/Asynchronous_Invocations.html">do 
the same with EJB 3.</a> In Seam, using these features was simply a 
matter of adding the appropriate configuration (as we do in Spring) to 
enable the executor (they have a few, including one based on the EJB3 
Timer and one based Quartz.) The usage here is familiar to what has 
recently been debuted in Spring 3.0. </p><p> Clearly, the need for 
such features is common enough that they've both been fully 
incorporated <a 
href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-7627/bnbpe?a=view">into 
JEE6 and EJB3.1.</a> There, you can specify CRON expressions as well 
as defer the invocation of a method using the 
<code>@Asynchronous</code> or <code>@Schedule</code> annotations. A 
simple example looks like: 
</p><P><PRE><CODE>package com.joshlong.ejb.timer ; 
import java.util.Date; 
import java.util.logging.Logger; 
import javax.annotation.Resource; 
import javax.ejb.Schedule; 
import javax.ejb.Asynchronous; 
import javax.ejb.Stateless; 
import javax.ejb.Timeout; 
import javax.ejb.Timer; 
import javax.ejb.TimerService; 
@Singleton 
public class PeriodicGreeter { 
 // you could use this to schedule things manually 
 @Resource TimerService timerService; 
 // or use the annotations to do so automatically 
 @Schedule(minute="*/3", hour="*") 
 public void sayHelloPeriodically() { 
   System.out.println( String.format( "Hello, world, at %s" , new 
Date()) ) ; 
 } 
 @Asynchronous 
 public Future&lt;String&gt; sayHelloAsynchronously() { 
   System.out.println( String.format( "Hello, world, at %s" , new 
Date()) ) ; 
   // ... 
 } 
}</CODE></PRE> 
</p> 
<h2> Spring 3.0 Implementation </h2> 
<p> 
The <code>task</code> namespace let's you declaratively configure a 
<code>TaskScheduler</code> and a <code>TaskExecutor</code> instance 
using XML. From here, you can configure beans that have scheduled, or 
asynchronous, executions using the XML or - my personal favorite if 
you can get access to the code - via Java annotations. </p> <p>Here's 
an example Spring application context featuring this namespace and 
configuring a scheduler and executor with default-ish settings:</p> 
<P><PRE><CODE> 
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; 
&lt;beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" 
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
   xmlns:task="http://www.springframework.org/schema/task" 
   xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context" 
   xsi:schemaLocation=" 
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans 
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd 
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/lang 
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/lang/spring-lang-3.0.xsd 
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/context 
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-3.0.xsd 
       <b>http://www.springframework.org/schema/task 
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/task/spring-task-3.0.xsd</b>"&gt; 
 &lt;context:annotation-config/&gt; 
 &lt;context:component-scan annotation-config="true" 
       base-package="com.yourbasepackage.scheduling" /&gt; 
<B> 
 &lt;task:scheduler id="scheduler" pool-size="10"/&gt; 
 &lt;task:executor id="executor" pool-size="10"/&gt; 
 &lt;task:annotation-driven scheduler="scheduler" executor = "executor" /&gt; 
</B> 
&lt;/beans&gt; 
</CODE></PRE></P> 
<P> What you do from here is up to you. You could simply start 
defining tasks inline with your XML. 
That approach certainly has its redeeming qualities, not the least of 
which is that your code is more readily "documented" and 
<i>conceivably</i> 
adjustable at runtime with some refresh trickery... sure.. you 
<i>could.</i></p> 
<CODE><PRE> 
&lt;task:scheduled-tasks scheduler="myScheduler"&gt; 
 &lt;task:scheduled ref="greeter" method="sayHello" fixed-delay="5000"/&gt; 
 &lt;task:scheduled ref="greeter" method="sayHello" fixed-rate="5000"/&gt; 
 &lt;task:scheduled ref="greeter" method="sayHello" cron="*/5 * * * 
* MON-FRI"/&gt; 
&lt;task:scheduled-tasks/&gt; 
</PRE></CODE> 
<p>...In practice, however, the annotation approach just <i>FEELS</i> 
soo much better! So, here is how you might write a scheduled or 
asynchronous bean in Spring. 
</p> 
<PRE><CODE>package com.joshlong.spring.timer ; 
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; 
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled; 
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component; 
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct; 
import javax.annotation.Resource; 
import java.util.Date; 
@Component 
public class SpringPeriodicGreeter { 
 // you can do everything you normally would using Spring, obviously 
 @Autowired CustomerService customerService ; 
 // this runs once every 5 minutes 
 @Scheduled(fixedRate = 1000 * 60 * 5) 
 public void sayHelloEveryFiveMinutes() { 
   System.out.println( String.format( "Hello, world, at %s" , new 
Date()) ) ; 
 } 
 @Scheduled(cron="*/5 * * * * MON-FRI") 
 public void sayHelloOnlyOneWeekdays() { 
   System.out.println( String.format( "Hello, world, at %s" , 
new Date()) ) ; 
 } 
 @Async 
 public void doSomething(String s) { 
  // this will be executed asynchronously 
 } 
 @Async 
 public Future&lt;String&gt; returnSomething(int i) { 
   // this will be executed asynchronously, but you can get the 
   // result by blocking on <code>Future.get</code> 
 } 
} 
</CODE></PRE> 
<p> Thus, this is nothing too strange - very simialar in fact to 
what's in JEE6. Obviously, I've not mentioned <i>every</i> permutation 
of the features from the various technologies, but hopefully this gets 
you past the initial cognitive "hump" of adapting a new technology. 
It helps that - at least in the Spring case - it's dead simple to 
start using it if you're already using Spring. 
I wonder if there will be support for working with 
the JEE6 annotations that describe the same things? The major 
takeaways are that you can get this simply by updating your version of 
Spring, which should be painless if you're not tied to Java 1.4. You 
can get the JEE6 functionality by updating your version of the 
platform and server, if the platform/server are ready (Glassfish is!). 
</p> 
<h2>Use</h2> 
<P> Now, as to <i>where</i> this stuff might be used, well, I can only 
think of a few <i>thousand</i> things... </p> 
<OL><LI> Quartz is probably still more powerful, but the 
implementation and usage are hackneyed - this new approach will feel 
much more elegant. You could probably get away with removing the old 
Quartz code and using this for most of your implementation needs. 
</LI> 
<LI>Because Spring's implementations are swappable, you could back 
this functionality with varying TaskExecutors/TaskSchedulers of your 
own implementation, if you wanted.</LI><LI>The obvious use case is 
that you can now remove <b>CRON</b>, <b>Autosys,</b> <b>Flux</b> and 
any number of other third-party, dedicated middleware schedulers from 
your architecture (if you're only using them to run Java 
services.)</LI> 
<LI>As with Spring itself, this abstraction is useful because you can 
deploy it inside of a web applicatior or any other place you can 
imagine Spring running, so you don't need to install a scheduler if 
you just want something run periodically inside your web container 
</LI> 
<li>If you have a Spring Batch job, this might be an ideal way to kick 
the jobs off periodically. You need to start processing the billing 
batch every night at 2am, but only on weekdays? This is a match made 
in heaven! How you get a Batch job to start running is left mainly as 
an exercise to the user. I recommend using an ESB (like Spring 
Integration) to react to events, or using a scheduler like this 
<code>task</code> namespace (or Quartz) to kick the jobs off. </li> 
<li>Spring Integration has a gateway mechanism that lets you front 
what is essentially a send (and/or) recieve operation on a channel 
(think: JMS queue/topic) with a method on an interface. I <i>love</i> 
this feature and use it a lot because I don't want to surface JMS 
queues / topics to the client (that's a little <i>too</i> loose and 
decoupled an API!). I also use it because it allows me to model 
fire-n-forget messaging using Java interfaces, which is exactly what 
the <code>@Async</code> annotation does. The other benefit of the 
Spring Integration feature is that the processing leaves the VM and 
goes somewhere to finish (ostensibly, wherever the consumer for the 
topic/queue lives) the job and then return the result. This provides 
scalability benefits to both the client <i>and</i> the server, whereas 
the <code>@Async</code> annotation would only increase the thoroughput 
of the client, in this case: processing still takes place on the node 
with the <code>@Async</code> annotation, it's simply deferred... 
Deferment <i>is </i> a valid way to increase capacity while decreasing 
thoroughput.</li>
