I regretfully share that I've had to drop out of OSCON 2016. I've wanted to be back at OSCON, especially in light of its move to Austin, and I tried very hard to reschedule but it was not to be. That said, it looks like you'll be in good hands! I've had my friend [Kenny](https://twitter.com/kennybastani) substitute for me at the _Cloud Native Workshop_ workshop and it looks like [Baruch](https://twitter.com/jbaruch) will be able to give another talk even though I've had to drop out of our joint submission. I'm so very sad to miss this year's show! It looks _amazing_! Here's to next year..
