<p> Anyone else noticing the extreme slowness of Java applications on
Ubuntu 8.10?  I upgraded and was expecting that the seminal Java 6u10
(strike that!<b> 11! </b>)  would do better than this.
</p>
<p> I was expecting draggable applets and for the performance of my
Java applications to not deteriorate. I was disappointed on both
fronts.

If you're having issues with IntelliJ crawling, a lot of people have
downgraded to 8.04 Ubuntu. </p>
