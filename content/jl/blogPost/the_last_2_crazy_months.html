<p>What a busy couple of months!   </p><p>I started last month (from 
October 2nd to the 11th) at the <a 
href="http://www.java2days.com">Java2Days</a> conference in Sofia, 
Bulgaria. I gave three talks on Spring and JSF, Spring and jBPM, and 
Spring Integration (the Spring ESB-like framework). I think the slides 
will be available there in shortly. Meanwhile, here are some photos of 
the event below, though you're encouraged to log in to Facebook and 
check out the full galleries <a

</td></tr></table><p> I had a great time at the conference.  The 
audience was great the discussions great, too. The drinking was good, 
too! :-) 
 </p><p> At some point, I got some sort of stomach bug (perhaps in 
Greece?) and when I returned home, I was severely dehyrdated. I spent 
a little time hooked up to an IV and then spent the subsequent week 
pounding antibiotics, gatorade, and soup. There's a   thousand ways to 
get sick, only one way to get better!  </p><p>After that, I got deep 
into the final edits for my book  "<a 
href="http://www.amazon.com/Spring-Enterprise-Recipes-Problem-Solution-Approach/dp/1430224975">Spring</a> 
<a href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/9781430224976">Enterprise</a> 
<a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Spring-Enterprise-Recipes/Gary-Mak/e/9781430224976">Recipes</a>." 
Really enjoyed that process - it's fascinating to see what goes into 
writing a book. Trust me, the book is far better for the effort of the 
amazing editors at Apress! :-)  </p> <p> I spoke at the <a 
href="http://www.pasadenajug.org/2009/10/spring-in-fall.html">Pasadena 
Java User Group</a> on using Spring Integration - that crowd was very 
cool and the discussion that ensued was also good. </p><p>  Recently, 
my sister got hitched. I wish her, and her husband, many happy days 
together. </p><p> I think that wraps up the highlights. I'll start 
chiming in more frequently. A lot has happened of late, including the 
debut of Google's <a href="http://www.golang.org">Go programming 
language</a>, The <a 
href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/Motorola-DROID-US-EN">Motorola 
Droid</a>, the continued standoff between Sun/Oracle and the European 
Union over objections to Oracle's accquisition of MySQL, and more. 
Exciting times...
