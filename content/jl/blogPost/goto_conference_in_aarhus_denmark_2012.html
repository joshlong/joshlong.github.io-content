<P> <img  src = "/media/18429"/> <br/> I'll be speaking at the GOTO conference in Aarhus, Denmark, from October 1-3 talking about <a href ="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/presentation/Spring%20and%20Cloud%20Foundry:%20a%20Marriage%20Made%20in%20Heaven">Cloud Foundry, the open-source PaaS from VMWare</a>. If you're at the show, I'd love to meet you! We can talk all things Spring, and Cloud Foundry, or just throw back a beer.
