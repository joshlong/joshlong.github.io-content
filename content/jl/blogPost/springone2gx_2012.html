 <img src = "/media/18461"/> </div>It's my favorite time of year! SpringOne2GX kicks off tomorrow. I'll be <A href="http://springone2gx.com/conference/washington/2012/10/speakers/josh_long">giving two talks</a> -- the Cloud Foundry Bootcamp, introducing Cloud Foundry for the Spring developer, and my talk on enterprise application integration and batch processing on Cloud Foundry.  This year's already more exciting than ever before, with talks on Spring, Cloud Foundry, Grails, Hadoop and Scala, and much more.  If you're around, feel free to find me roaming the halls <a href="http://www.twitter.com/starbuxman">or ping me on Twitter</a>!
