<P> Merry Christmas! Feliz Navidad! Joyeux Noel! Feliz natal! 
 </P>
<p> It's already <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_day">Boxing day</a>, or - as we call it   in Shanghai, "Wednesday" (I translated that from the original Mandarin for you).</p> 
<p> Christmas was such a trip here in China. It's celebrated like people in the west celebrate St. Patty's day: a chance to shop at discount sales, drink and hang out with friends, and potentially take the day off. And, shop they do. China's economy's growing, while the economies in the US and Europe have slowed. Last year, in 2011, the average affluent Chinese spent the holiday abroad and - in England, for example, spent 1300 pounds for the holiday (avergage). (By comparison, the average wealthy Englishman spent 1200 or so pounds). What an amazing phenomenon. One thing that was a big seller, the 'Christmas Apple', which - as I understand it - sounds in the Chinese language like the words for 'Christmas Eve.' What salesmanship. That said, I've never had a Christmas apple, and I think I should like to try one. I wonder if they'll have after-Christmas sales?
