<p> A lengthy upgrade process caused my blog to die, but it's back! </P> 

<p>  Usually when I upgrade the software it's not so big a deal, but this version introduced  a few new components into the architecture, which complicated things.  I really ought to open-source this sucker. 

</p> <p>Anyway, there's very little that you - dear reader - would likely see in the new software. But stick around, that's to come! </p>
