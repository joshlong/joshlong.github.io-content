I just concluded a wonderful Devoxx FR where I was reunited with old friends and spoke to people about cloud native (reactive) Spring.

I did two workshops (one at Devoxx FR, and another for Zenika, as a meetup, in the evening) and then co-presented with Spring co-founder and my hero (and freind) Juergen Hoeller. It was a lot of fun and I want to thank all those that turned up! It was an honor!

Now it's off to the states for some business then I return to Europe, Sunday, [for JAX in Mainz, Germany](https://jax.de/programm/). There, I'll co-present _again_ with Juergen. I speak French (so that helped in Paris) and he speaks German (that'll help in Mainz)! It's a nice symmetry. We'll even have a bit more time to articulate our ideas - an hour! I'll also be doing a _Cloud Native Java_ book signing at JAX, so don't miss that!

They announced that JavaDays Ukraine would soon join the Devoxx franchise and family as Devoxx Ukraine and Juergen and I have already been invited to speak there. I sure hope we can! Congratulations to the team. It looks like it's going to be an exciting adventure.

Then, it's off to Linz, Austria (where Juergen lives, no less), [for the DevOne show](https://devone.at/). There, again, Juergen and I will co-present on all things Reactive Spring. If you're there, don't miss this opportunity to meet Juergen Hoeller, one of the greats!

On the 27th, I'll be presenting at a meetup [in Vienna, Austria](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Enterprise-Java-User-Group-Austria/events/249259945/).

Then, on 2-3 May I'll be in Melbourne, Australia, and the [VOXXED Melbourne event](https://voxxeddays.com/melbourne/). This is exciting! I'll be co-presenting with the _other_ Spring co-founder, Rod Johnson, in his native Australia! Do _not_ miss this!

Then, it's off to Manchester, [UK for a meetup on the 9th of May, 2018](https://www.meetup.com/ManchesterUK-Java-Community/events/248184150/). Do you want to miss this? I think not!

From there, I'll head to [Devoxx UK](https://www.devoxx.co.uk/), one of my all time favorite shows, in London on the 9th to 11th May. I'll also be speaking to customers there.

Then, it's off to Denver, Colorado for the [epic SpringOne Tour Denver event](https://springonetour.io/2018/denver) on the 14th. These SpringOne Tour events sell out quick, so don't miss this one!

From Denver, I head off to Kyiv, Ukraine for a [JUG meeting](http://jug.ua/). I'll also be presenting at the [JEEConf](https://jeeconf.com/) event on the 18th of May. Juergen and I will again be co-presenting there!

I'll be in Dublin an Belfast speaking to customers and _hopefully_ doing a JUG on the 21st of May.

Then, from there, it's off to the legendary [Spring I/O](https://2018.springio.net/) event  in beautful (_bootiful_) Bercelona, Spain! Join us!

Then, finally, I'll return home to San Francisco for a few days in the sun before I make the trek to Singapore for the epic [VOXXED Singapore event](https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/).

Needless to say, if you're in any of the regions in which I'm speaking I'd love to see you there and hear from you!
