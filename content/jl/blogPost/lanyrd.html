<P> If you guys want to know when and where I'll be speaking next, feel free to check out my <A href ="http://lanyrd.com/profile/starbuxman/">Lanyrd.com</a> page, which usually has information about which shows I'll be at and where. In fact, some times <EM>I</EM> check it out and learn of my obligations before I've been told!  <br/> <img  width = "800" style = "margin-top:10px;" src = "/media/18436"/>
