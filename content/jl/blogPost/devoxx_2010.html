<p>  
 I've just returned from Devoxx 2010 where I manned the SpringSource booth and talked to members from the community and gave a talk on the latest and greatest in the wide world of Spring. It was a lot of fun, but I'm glad to be home! There's a bit of downtown for those of us in the states as we celebrate Thanksgiving. Looking forward to catching up on some work!</p>
<P>Then, I'm off to speak at the Salesforce.com <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/Dreamforce">Dreamforce conference</a>. I'll be giving an intro to <a href="http://www.springsource.org/about">Spring</a> for the busy Force.com developer with my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/quintonwall">Quinton Wall,</a> the SalesForce.com evangelist. This talk will be useful for developers interested in moving to the <a href="http://www.vmforce.com">VMforce</a> cloud, coming from a Force.com background. 
 The event looks to be <em>very</em> interesting (beyond the incredibly cool technical sessions, I hear Bill Clinton's giving a keynote, and Stevie Wonder's the musical talent... not too shabby!), so don't miss it!</p>
