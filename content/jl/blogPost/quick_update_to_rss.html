<p> I just published a change to the code that should hopefully
prevent readers (like <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google
Reader</a>) from constantly requeuing all my old blog entries as
"unread." ï¿½I don't know if it'll work (I've never had to debug this
particular web client!), but we'll see. </p><p>I suspect the issue is
something like the following: the spider hits the page which in turn
causes it to get a cookie from Java Server Faces, which makes the blog
feed look "new." I've checked the last modified dates and so on using
<a href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/">Http Live Headers</a> and
the Last-Modified dates and everything look alright. Anyway, I'll post
back with results once they manifest (or, hopefully, don't manifest!)
</p> <p>Succinctly, the change involved creating a servlet (sort of)
and using that to write/render (I wanted to say "feed") the feed.</p>
