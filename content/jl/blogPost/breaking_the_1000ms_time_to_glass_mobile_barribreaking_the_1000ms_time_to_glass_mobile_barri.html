<P>I just found this video on reddit.com, <a href="">Breaking the 1000ms Time to Glass
Mobile Barrier</a>. </p><P>
It's a video from a  Googler - <A href="http://twitter.com/igrigorik">Ilya Grigorik</a> -  on delivering applications that <EM>render</EM> in
under much less than 1000ms, not just time to first byte.
</p><P>
This is particularly interesting because he's got a  <EM>lot</EM>  of great
data points on user tendencies given slower experiences, and on
experiences on the dektop vs. mobile, etc.
</p><P>
I don't expect this is all completely new to anyone, but I certainly
learned a few things! This is a nice talk if you like performance, and   could definitely inform some of the discussion on resource pipelines, mobile, and
javascript and web applications.
