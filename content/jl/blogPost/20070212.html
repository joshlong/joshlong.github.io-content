<p>Aside from all the new APIs supported (and there are a LOT – some only previously available through extensions. Notable among them: Java APIs for Bluetooth ( JSR 82), Wireless Messaging API (WMA, JSR 226), and J2ME Web Services Specification (JSR 172), and of course we can’t forget.. argh... just check out <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/download-2_5.html">Sun's page</a> for the full scoop), the coolest thing for me has to be the standard support for the Location API’s. These APIs, of course have helped propel J2ME into orbit via Google’s "Google Mobile Maps" application (and the plethora of other maps / GPS applications out there helped, too, I suppose :-) )<br><br>This is an impressive release and long-awaited. One gripe: where’s my Linux SDK? I’ll have to use the windows version for now, I suppose. I should count my blessings: there doesn’t seem to be any mention of a Mac version!</p>
