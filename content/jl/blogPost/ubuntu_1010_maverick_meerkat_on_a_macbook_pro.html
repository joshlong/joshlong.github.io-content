<p> I have long used <a href="http://refit.sourceforge.net/">rEFIt</a> to install Ubuntu on a MacBook Pro. Simply install rEFIt as instructed on the site and then install Ubuntu on the newly created partition. No weirdness. Depending on your hardware, you may need to make sure that the Ubuntu installer program uses <i>nomemset</i>. This wasn't the case for me. </p><p>This setup lets me have my favorite operating system on (admittedly) fairly nice (albeit overpriced) Intel x86 machines.  However, the latest generation of MacBook Pros <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/linux/+bug/576601">have caused me no end of grief with Ubuntu 10.04.</a> Ubuntu 10.10, Maverick Meerkat, remies everthing and I'm happy to report I'm running the release candidate of Ubuntu 10.10 on my Macbook Pro as I type this. </p><p>Everything seems to be working fairly well. I put this post out to confirm it can work for you on a Mac, and to also point people <a href="http://www.pagondel.org/how-to-instalar-vmware-en-ubuntu-10-10-64-bits/">to this</a> page if they're having trouble getting <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/">VMware's excellent VMware Player</a> product working on 10.10. </p>
