<p>Spring Boot is a convention-over-configuration <a href="http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">centric approach to application development with Spring</a>.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to get started.</p>

<p>In principal, the easiest way to get started is to just reuse somebody else's handcrafted build file and project setup. There are code-generators that make this easy. The Node-ecosystem tool <code>yo</code> offers a  code-generator  <a href="http://jhipster.github.io/"> called <code>generator-jhipster</code></a>. The projects generated with JHipster are web applications built using Maven, Spring, and Angular.js. The Groovy-language ecosystem codegenerator <a href="https://github.com/pledbrook/lazybones">Lazy Bones</a> can code-generate Spring Boot applications for you, as well.</p>

<p>For me, nothing beats the <a href="http://start.spring.io">Spring Initializr</a>. It's simply a small form that's pre-filled out with useful values. You might make sure to specify Java 1.8, and check the boxes for <code>Web</code>, <code>JPA</code> (or any of the other supported data-access technologies like MongoDB), and <code>Actuator</code>. This is a safe first-application. Once you've specified your Java revision (you <em>are</em> on Java 1.8, aren't you?), specify the type of project you'd like. Many people will know what to do with the default, a <code>Maven Project</code>. This will be importable into any IDE, straight-Eclipse, IntelliJ (Community or Ultimate), NetBeans, etc. I'd leave the version ( - the latest stable release) and the project type  set to the defaults. Click <code>Generate</code> to download a an archive. Unzip it and then import it into your favorite IDE as a Maven project.</p>

<p>If you're using  our open-source Eclipse distribution <a href="https://spring.io/tools/sts">Spring Tool Suite (STS)</a>, there are many ways to get started. We base STS on the latest-and-greatest cut of the Eclipse Java EE distribution, so it represents a stable, well-integrated distibution of Eclipse.  The Spring Tool Suite provides extra tools and niceties. One such nicety is  a dialog within the IDE that acts as a  front for the Spring Initializr.  It's nice skipping the download, unzip, and import steps!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://spring,io/guides">spring.io guides</a> provide easy-to-digest introductions to using Spring (or Spring ecosystem technologies). Each guide is backed by a Github repository that demonstrates the finished project as well as provides a base template that you can fill out when completing the guide. There's a nice feature in STS that lets you import a <em>Getting Started</em> guide directly from the IDE, by going to <code>File</code> -> <code>New</code> -> <code>Import Spring Getting Started Content</code>. This saves you the <code>git clone</code>, and IDE-import.</p>

<p>I've <a href="//www.youtube.com/embed/p8AdyMlpmPk">put together a video that shows what it looks like to use the tools in  Spring Tool Suite (STS)</a>,</p>
