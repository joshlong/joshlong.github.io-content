<p>Today, I'll begin another adventure, going to work in Shanghai, China, for two months where I'll be able to work with the Cloud Foundry Shanghai teams and more fully take in life in the next <em>empire</em>.
I'm not sure if this blog will be available there, but if it is, I'll try to post updates as often as I can. If you can read this in China, feel free to reach me at josh (at) joshlong (dot) com. I'd love an opportunity to potentially talk to your organization about how you're using Spring and / or Cloud Foundry, or - if you're running an event or meet-up or conference and would like a speaker, I'd also be interested in hearing from you.</P><p>And of course, I look forward to meeting any and all of you in the near future at both SpringOne India and SpringOne China events, both of which I'll be at during my time in China!</p><p>
Wish me luck!
