<p>This last week I've been in Paris, France talking to developers about Spring 4 and Spring Boot.  I landed on Sunday, gave myself a day to recover from any jet lag.  The jetlag sorted itself off within a few days but left me very, very tired the day of a my webinar for the <a href="htp://youtube.com/springsourcedev">SpringSourceDev YouTube channel</a>. When we on the Spring team give webinars, we do two of them - one for those in Europe and the middle-east and another for north America. The hope is that this presents an opportunity for developers around the world to join the fun. So, as usual, I tested the hotel Wi-Fi's strength by conducting a Skype video call and a Google+ hangout. Worked fine. 16:00 CEST rolls around and I connect to do the first webinar, say a few words and then - (gasp!) - silence! I was disconnected! I called downstairs and asked what happened: they were changing ISPs! You could've knocked me down with a feather. I was about to address a <em>lot</em> of people and here the hotel's decided to switch ISPs! I ran down the hallway, descended and implored whoever could help to please help me. The lobby had a separate network, so I connected and presented my first webinar in the middle of a Marriot lobby as people walked by, talking, laughing, screaming. Amazing. <em>Quel cauchmar!</em></p>

<p>The second webinar went off with far less fanfare, happily.</p>

<p>This year's Devoxx was <EM>amazing</EM>! I came bearing messages of Spring 4 and Spring Boot. The talks seemed to draw a large crowd and it was clear that people are very interested in both, especially in so far as you can use the Spring 4 technologies inside of Spring Boot.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to being at Devoxx UK in a months time and, hopefully, Devoxx Belgium later this year.</p>

<p>Now, I'm on a plane headed to Bangalore, India for the <a href="http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/speakers.html">Great Indian Developer Summit</a> where I'll also be presenting on Spring Boot and Spring 4, among other things. Every trip to India I've ever taken has been amazing, and I don't expect this one will be any different! C'ya there!</p>

<p> I'd like to think these people were reacting to me, but my  hunch is that they're just happy because of <A href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot">Spring and Spring Boot</a>.  :D
