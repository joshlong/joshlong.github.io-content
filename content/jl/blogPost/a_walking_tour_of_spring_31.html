<P> I put together a quick walking tour of Spring 3.1. The code is available on <a href = "https://github.com/joshlong/a-walking-tour-of-spring-31">my GitHub account</A>. It runs on a Servlet 3 container, and demonstrates how to build a completely XML free (no <CODE>persistence.xml</CODE>, no <CODE>web.xml</CODE>, no <CODE>orm.xml</CODE>, etc.) application that uses Hibernate 4, Spring 3.1, and Spring MVC 3.1. It shows how to build everything from a transactional service to a RESTful endpoint.   </P>
