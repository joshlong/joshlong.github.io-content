This was my first time in Madrid, Spain, for the <a href = "http://www.springio.net/">Spring IO conference</a>. 
	I enjoyed the people, the culture (<EM>y las bebidas!</EM>) and  more. I brought my dad with me on this trip, since he's never been abroad, and I wanted him to see Europe with me. We had talked about this when I went to <a href = "http://www.javazone.no">JavaZone</A>, last year, and I described to him that there were <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fjord"><EM>fjords</EM></A> and plenty of beautiful wildlife and vast expanses of nature's beauty. That trip, for reasons not that relevant here, never panned out for us (although I quite enjoyed it!). 
	JavaZone came and went, but he was still interested in Scandinavia and experiencing that type of culture. 
	When this trip (first to Stockholm, Sweden, for <a href = "http://jfokus.com">JFokus</A>, and then to Madrid, Spain, for <a href = "http://www.springio.net">Spring I/O</A>) materialized, dad jumped at the chance. I bought his tickets (a late birthday gift - we share the same birthday!) and I asked him to secure a passport, which he did. 
	</P><p>
 He was most looking forward to visiting Stockholm. Stockholm is every bit as lovely as he imagined it would be, having seen <a href = "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132620/"><EM>The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo</EM></A>.
	
	</P><P>
	But, dad fell ill - something he ate didn't agree with him (probably the airline food!) - and he was trapped in the hotel for a few days, and very weak. This made moving around a bit more problematic than it should have been as we made the subsequent trip to Madrid, Spain.     
	
	 One thing we <em>did</EM> learn: getting sick in a hotel room's a good idea, especially in Stockholm.  
		The staff at the hotel we stayed at - the lovely <a href="http://www.radissonblu.com/waterfronthotel-stockholm">Radisson Blu Waterfront</a> in Stockholm, right next to the JFokus venue -
		treated him exceptionally.  
		
	 It seemed as though the staff was almost rooting for him to recover! Somebody even <EM>checked in</EM> on him for me, while I was tending to my obligations as  a speaker at the conference! Talk about great service.  	
	</P> 
    
    <P> During all of this, I took a quick jaunt (a train, then a flight, then a cab) from Stockholm, Sweden to Helsinki, Finland's port, where I jumped on a cruise headed <EM>back</EM> to Stockholm! This cruise, in particular was the vessel on which the Vaadin Dev Days took place. It was an amazing, enthusiastic group of programmers, and you couldn't ask for a more interesting venue. I enjoyed everything, and particularly, I enjoyed giving a talk against the background sound of ice breaking as the ship plowed onward, through the frozen waters. Adding that to the list of things that I can't beleive I got to do... </P>
    <P>
 We finally made it to  Madrid. By that point dad was on the mend, and  the temperature in Madrid was more favorable to people of, em,  superior years. It was a <Em> lot</EM> warmer than in Stockholm. Madrid seems like it was realized from a story book  illustration: nice people, great food and - most manifestly for an American like my dear dad, never before abroad in his 75+ years of life -  full of <EM>beautiful</EM> architecture!
	 Madrid ended up being his favorite city.  
	</p>
<P>
		
		It didn't hurt that  the conference coincided with <EM>carnivale</EM>, which was being celebrated in some form or another  in many different Catholic countries world-wide. The streets were abuzz with music, debauchery and crowds of people.  Dad and I went outside, took in some of the scenery and had to find a place to sit when one of the <a href  = "http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifestaci%C3%B3n"><em>Manifestaci&oacute;n</EM></A>s <a href = "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/3386ce2e-5b29-11e1-a2b3-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F3386ce2e-5b29-11e1-a2b3-00144feabdc0.html&_i_referer=">plowed</a> <a href = "http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/02/hundreds-of-thousands-of-spaniards-protest-new-work-rules.html">through</A> <a href  = "https://news.google.com/news/story?ncl=dMYiSTv25wTOfTMZl-DHtPx4bvXCM">the center</A> where we were! What an incredible thing to behold! We missed the memo, evidently, where it was announced that the entire walking population of Madrid would go on a walkabout!

    <P>I really enjoyed JFokus, the Vaadin Dev Days, and finally Spring IO both because they were great events with enthusiastic developers, but also because I got to go with my dad, who got to experience Europe for the first time with me. We learned a lot. I'll be back in Europe next month for <a href = "http://2012.33degree.org/">33rd Degree</a>, and I'll be in Sweden, <EM>again</EM>(!), and in numerous other countries in April for <a href = "http://www.scandevconf.se/">ScanDevConf</a> and the <a href="http://opentour.cloudfoundry.com/">Cloud Foundry Open Tour</a> (which we'll talk about a bit later), respectively, and I'll be sure to approach those trips in the same  way as my dad did: full of a (renewed) curiousity.
