Kenny and I have been hard at work on the O'Reilly _Cloud Native Java_ book, and Phil and I have been hard at work on the updated _Building Microservices with Spring Boot LiveLessons_ for the more in-depth introductions to Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, but I am _very_ happy to report that we on the Spring team _finally_ started to add guides to the [Spring Guides section](http://spring.io/guides) on [service registration and discovery](http://spring.io/guides/gs/service-registration-and-discovery/), [Zuul-based microproxies for routing and filtering](http://spring.io/guides/gs/routing-and-filtering/), [circuit breakers](http://spring.io/guides/gs/circuit-breaker/), and [centralized configuration](http://spring.io/guides/gs/centralized-configuration/)! Get 'em while they're hot!
