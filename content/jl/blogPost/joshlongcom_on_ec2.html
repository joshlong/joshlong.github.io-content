<p> This is my first working version of the system being posted from the EC2 cloud. Performance seems alright. I'll update as I dig more into the capabilities. So far getting things up and running has been relatively painless. 
 There's something inherently awesome about being able to login and setup your own server without having to beg for certain extra capabilities.
