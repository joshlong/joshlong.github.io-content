<p>My first article for <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/tt/articles/article.tss?l=jBPMandSpring">TheServerSide.com</a>. I am very excited to have this finally happen, and am frankly really looking forward to doing some more. The article is a discussion on setting up an architecture using worklists that depends on jBPM and Spring.
