<P>  I recently had somebody ask me what the best content for getting started with <a href="http://neo4j.org/">Neo4J</a> is. Naturally, my answer was to grab <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/neo4j">Spring Data Graph</a> and don't look back. But that's not entirely fair. Admittedly, you might be better served by simply learning Neo4J and then layering in the Spring Data support to reduce a lot of the tedium. So, without further ado, here's a list of great content that I put together for people who are looking to learn Neo4j and Spring Data Graph (which works with Neo4j.).

 Start with <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/snapshot/">the documentation</a>, of course. Like SpringSource, the Neo4j team goes to extreme lengths to make sure their documentation reflects the APIs as the APIs evolve. If you want to get an idea of <EM> how </eM> extreme, just ask <a href="http://www.twitter.com/peterneubauer">Peter Neubauer</a>.   The docs provide a good introduction to the APIs and modeling concepts and - in parts III and IV - introduce  how to operate, scale and manage Neo4j instances.

 Jim Webber, lead author of <A href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805838.do">REST in Practice</A> (one of my favorite books, by the way!), now works for Neo4j Inc., and he put togehter an amazing <A href="https://github.com/jimwebber/neo4j-tutorial">Koan-style tutorial for everybody to consume on Github</a>. Check it out!

 <LI>  Check out the videos. There are lots of them. Neo4J has their <a href="http://videos.neo4j.org">content on videos.neo4j.org</a>, and buried in all the great Spring content on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/SpringSourceDev">the SpringSourceDev channel on YouTube</a>, there's the 
     great introduction to the Spring Data Graph project with project <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qVs9vxx8lk">lead Dr. Mark Pollack and Neo4j CEO Emil Eifrem</a>.

 Steve Mayzak and I co-authored a   book, "<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920020981">Getting Started with Spring Roo</a>," from O'Reilly. We were honored to have 
            Michael Hunger, from the Neo4j team, contribute and co-author the content on the Roo addon for the Spring Data Graph  project.  O'Reilly has generously made this book available for free to the community; <a href="http://spring-roo-repository.springsource.org/Getting_Started_with_Roo.pdf">check it out!</a>  
 </LI>  <LI> For a great example (running, and open source, too!) of Spring Data Graph, check out <a href="http://blog.neo4j.org/2011/04/spring-data-graph-10-integration.html">this blog introducing the example along with some background information.</a> Then, check out <a href="https://github.com/springsource/spring-data-graph-examples">the source code</a>. 
</li> <LI>  Michael Hunger also co-authored an amazing book, <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-data/data-graph/snapshot-site/reference/pdf/spring-data-graph-reference.pdf">The Spring Data Graph Guide Book</a>.  This book is a <EM>great</EM> piece of content.
