The amazing [Pieter Hintjens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Hintjens) is not well. He's contributed a lot to the open-source community, notably to the AMQP protocol (which underpins RabbitMQ) and to ZeroMQ. He's talked about his state in a blog called [_A Protocol for Dying_](http://hintjens.com/blog:115). If you're a fan, perhaps now's your chance to let him know. If you're not a fan, then perhaps you could investigate some of his work? He [leads the ZeroMQ project](http://zeromq.org/), wrote [a few books](http://hintjens.com/books), and did a lot of great videos. I really liked this one [from 2015's Craft Conf](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/61450822). I'll be at Craft Conf (starting today, actually) this year and I'll be thinking of Pieter.
