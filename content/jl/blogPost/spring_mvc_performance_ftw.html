<P> We've all seen 
 <A href="http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/comparing_web_frameworks_and_html5"> Matt Raible's awesome talk</a>
 comparing  web frameworks with each other. He routinely gives this talk, often updating it as new technologies emerge. More often than not, Spring MVC and Grails emerge as leaders. These sorts of talks of course never have a conclusive winner, but, as I say, more often than not, Grails and Spring MVC emerge near - or at - the top of the stack in terms of community, ease of use, lines of code, performance, features, etc.

 For a very detailed dissection of performance, you might check out this talk <a href="http://www.java-tv.com/2013/02/11/jsf-gwt-springmvc-and-wicket-compared/">comparing web framework performance</a>. Matt's talk builds on the data amassed from that talk.
