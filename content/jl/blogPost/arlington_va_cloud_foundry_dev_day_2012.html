<P>  Fresh from SpringOne2GX, I'm in Arlington, VA, working with developers who want to get started with Cloud Foundry. This is a hands on event, and many of my colleagues and I are here to help developers get started. 
</p><P>
There are two tracks -- one track focusing on application development using Cloud Foundry: getting started with the tools, setting up the environment, pushing applications to the cloud, and managing the application once it's there. The other track    focuses on Cloud Foundry internals and architecture. The turn out has been great, and it's great to see so many developers using the technology so enthusiastically.    People are already pushing and migrating their existing, sophisticated Spring based applications to Cloud Foundry!
