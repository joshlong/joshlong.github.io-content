<p>I just visited the Phillipines. While there, my-brother-in-law gave me a hard disk with 60GBs of photographs. I
    wanted them on Flickr. Complicating matters further were the photos that my girl's photos. Her photos - every
    blessed one of them -- were perfect. Mine, on the other hand, were an affront to color, tone, lighting and God.
    Nothing short of a week in front of GIMP and Flickr could save them. </p>

<p>
    Nothing, that is, except perhaps some automation. I devised a plan: auto color correct the images using ImageMagic
    (You know how Photoshop has the "Auto Levels" command that transforms images from Warhol's to Monet's?), correct
    some of the EXIF issues I had, and then upload all 65GBs of photos to Flickr. </p>
<h2>Approach </h2>
<P>
    I chose Ruby for the solution because I've worked with some of these APIs before. I know how I would approach this
    problem from Java: <a href="http://jmagick.wiki.sourceforge.net">JMagick</a> for ImageMagick access, <a
        href="http://flickrj.sourceforge.net/">FlickrJ</a> for Flickr, and I'd probably just shell out to
    <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool"><code>exiftool</code></a>, which is a command line tool on
    Linux. I've disabused myself of the notion that this script going on to become the 100 lines of code that topples
    Microsoft, and thus I don't care if it just works on Linux. </p>
<P>
    I chose not to use Java because, frankly, I'm really picky about how I build my Java applications. Picky, to the
    point that sometimes it hinders me when I'm just trying to express an application. Unless it's for the most trivial
    of applications (where "trivial" most certainly does NOT include assimilating 3 different libraries and performing
    image processing for 2 days) I can't help but introduce elements from my war chest. </p><p>My war chest is derived
    from years of doing this singular task, from programming in Java. Years of experience have taught me to readily
    employ, for example: Maven, unit testing, persistence (so that I can keep track of what's been processed, for
    example) and with all of that, why not Spring? After all, I was going to write to interfaces anyway. My years of
    experience have taught me that I should plan the application out a little bit before I take to coding. After all, by
    the time I've integrated all those APIs, change will be slower going, and it's easier to refactor UML than DDL. My
    years of experience have made me slow for the small applications and fast for the big applications. </p>
<p>I chose not to use Python because I didn't know the APIs for Flickr that well in Python. Simple enough. I always use
    Python. It's the language I write my one-offs in. It's the language I go to when I want to express a solution
    without UML. It would have been perfect for this job. It's most redemptive quality is, in fact, how frequently I
    find myself thinking it would be perfect for a job. It inspires hope. But again, I don't know the API very well, no
    need to get lost in the weeds of Ruby offers a paved road. </P>
<h2>Prerequisites </h2>
<p>The players having been selected, I wrote a small checklist of what I'll need.</p>
<OL>
    <LI>

        <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/">Flickr API License key</a> Make sure you choose the non
        professional version.
    </li>
    <li> Photos</LI>
    <LI>Ruby compiler. And the gem command, definitely don't forget those. You'll need some packages to get this
        running. I installed the packges using my Operating Systems package manager. I'm using Ubuntu Hardy Heron. The
        script I used to reproduce the solution on another machine (and thus to whose viability I can speak) is: <br/>
<PRE><CODE>
    sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl
    sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libfreetype6
    sudo apt-get install libwmf0.2-7 ghostscript libjpeg62
    sudo apt-get install libpng3 libpng3-dev
    sudo apt-get install imagemagick
    sudo apt-get install make gcc autoconf ruby rubygems ruby1.8-dev libmagick9-dev

    sudo gem install rflickr
    sudo gem install rmagick
    sudo gem install mini_exiftool
    sudo gem install openwferu-extras
</CODE></pre>
    </li>
</oL>

<h2>Code! </h2>
<P>
    I took large swatches of this from loadr.rb script that ships with the Flickr library's source code. The application
    is anything if not fragile, and perhaps not even very efficient, but it does work, and that's what mattered here.
