I just deployed a new version of the Tapestry 4.1 archetype. It's the same parameters as the archetype discussed <a href="http://www.joshlong.com/jl/entry/20070227">previously</a>. Essentially, the new version provides a few new features:<br /><ol><li>an interesting use of an engine service (in this case to provide a working rounded corner generator, as with Google Groups' rounded corner generator URL) and a corresponding component to employ the service.</li><li>the rounded corner component mentioned above, which is pretty sophisticated in of itself (as introductory code goes, anyway!)</li><li>much better documentation (mvn site, and then peruse the resultant docs in the target directory.) <br /></li></ol>.<br />
