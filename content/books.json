Once you've gone reactive, it's super hard to go back, because  - deep down - you <em> know</em> you can  deliver more performant, robust, resilient, scalable software with reactive. Why would you do otherwise? I love reactive programming, because it makes writing production-worthy software easier and faster. In this book, <a href=\"http://www.ReactiveSpring.io\"><EM>Reactive Spring</em></a>, I'll show you why by introducing the wide world of reactive Spring. </P><P>Follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ReactiveSpring\">@ReactiveSpring</a> on Twitter for more</P>",
